Allergan, which has repeatedly rejected offers from Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc VRX.TO, would consider a takeover proposal that values the company at above $200 per share, some of these people said.

Actavis, which held informal conversations with Allergan in recent months about a possible combination, would like to take a hard look at buying the company and could reach out to its management team as soon as this week to reiterate its interest, one of the sources said.

There has been no formal engagement between the two companies yet, the sources said, asking not to be named because the matter is not public.

Separately, Valeant and its partner William Ackman are planning to boost their offer for Valeant by $15 per share to about $191 per share, the Wall Street Journal reported on Tuesday citing people familiar with the matter.

Allergan, while fighting off Valeant’s advances, did not reach out to other alternative buyers and instead focused on identifying opportunities for revenue growth and cost cuts internally. But it is aware of competing interest from other drugmakers, particularly from Actavis, the sources said.

The emergence of Actavis as a serious rival suitor adds another twist to the months-long takeover battle between Valeant and Allergan. The Canadian drugmaker’s bid already has attracted controversy because it is backed by activist investor Ackman, leading to a legal challenge from Allergan which has accused the two parties of insider trading.

Shares of Allergan ended 1.7 percent higher at $186.20 on the New York Stock Exchange after rising more than 3 percent on the news, valuing the company at more than $55 billion. Actavis closed at $243.39 for a market capitalization of roughly $64 billion.

Shares of Valeant fell 2.5 percent, putting the value of its existing cash and stock offer for Allergan at $175.94 per share, or $52.8 billion based on shares outstanding.

Analysts have an average price target of around $200 per share for Allergan, with the price ranging from $174 to $240 per share, according to a Thomson Reuters poll of 16 analysts.

Representatives for Allergan and Actavis declined to comment.

Actavis’ continued pursuit of Allergan comes as the takeover target faces a Dec. 18 special shareholder meeting, at which top Allergan investor Ackman’s Pershing Square Capital Management hopes to replace a majority of the company’s board.

Pershing Square has teamed up with Valeant to pursue a takeover of Allergan, and is hoping to install new board members who could be more receptive to a takeover by the Canadian drugmaker.

Actavis, which regularly reviews potential acquisitions, considers Allergan as the best opportunity currently and is hoping to engage in friendly discussions, the sources said.

Industry executives have said Actavis would be a better cultural fit for Allergan because the companies’ respective chief executives, Brent Saunders and David Pyott, believe in focusing on research and development, while Valeant CEO Mike Pearson is known for cost cutting.

A large part of Allergan’s business is ophthalmology, an area that Saunders is familiar with after serving as CEO of Bausch & Lomb. Valeant acquired Bausch & Lomb last year.

DEFENSIVE ACQUISITION UNLIKELY
Valeant and Pershing Square offered to buy Allergan on April 22 but Allergan has said the offer undervalued the company. Since then Allergan has announced cost cuts and said it was looking for acquisitions while trying to persuade shareholders they were better off remaining independent.

But the possibility of Allergan making a potentially large acquisition has faced significant opposition from shareholders who feared such a deal would make the company too big and expensive for Valeant.

Allergan had held on and off discussions with Salix Pharmaceuticals Ltd SLXP.O about buying the drugmaker for more than $10 billion in cash, people familiar with the matter said previously. A cash takeover would not have required a shareholder vote and could have put Allergan out of Valeant’s reach.

Those discussions stalled in part because Allergan considered Salix’s valuation as high, and while the company continues to look at other deal opportunities, the likelihood of it striking a big acquisition before the Dec. 18 shareholder meeting is low, the sources said.",

“This combination will greatly enhance our U.S. and international commercial opportunities,” said Paul Bisaro, executive chairman of Actavis.

The combined company of Activis and Allergan will have an expected $23 billion in revenue and will be led by Brent Saunders, CEO and president of Actavis. Bisaro will remain executive chairman, the company said.

“Today’s transaction provides Allergan stockholders with substantial and immediate value, as well as the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined company,” David E. I. Pyott, chairman and CEO of Allergan, said in a statement.

Allergan has spent six months maneuvering against a takeover by Ackman and Valeant, including in a legal battle. Pyott had said shareholders would be hurt because Valeant’s cost-cutting, particularly in research and development, would stop its growth, and he questioned Valeant’s accounting.

In a conference call following the announcement, Pyott said the decision to accept Actavis’ offer was related to similarities between the two companies’ commitment to research and development, to which the combined company will dedicate about $1.7 billion annually.

Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals appear to be giving up their pursuit of Allergan, the maker of Botox, as another big drug maker has trumped their hostile bid.","After seven months of bids, bluster and lawsuits, the hedge fund manager William A. Ackman and Valeant Pharmaceuticals appear to be giving up their pursuit of Allergan, the maker of Botox, as another big drug maker has trumped their hostile bid.

Allergan agreed on Monday to be acquired for $66 billion by Actavis in a deal worth $219 a share in cash and stock. The deal would be the biggest ever for Actavis and the largest acquisition in a year full of big deals, eclipsing Comcast’s $45 billion takeover of Time Warner Cable and AT&T’s $48.5 billion purchase of DirecTV. It would be the third-largest health care deal ever in the United States, according to Standard & Poor’s Capital IQ.

The deal capitalizes on a previous inversion deal by Actavis and presents a monumental roadblock for Valeant and Mr. Ackman, the unlikely consortium that teamed up in April to start what became the hostile campaign for Allergan.

In a statement after the announcement of the Actavis deal, Valeant’s chief executive, J. Michael Pearson, said, “While we will review any such agreement in determining our course of action, Valeant cannot justify to its own shareholders paying a price of $219 or more per share for Allergan.”

Actavis was until recently based in Parsippany, N.J. But last year it agreed to acquire an Irish drug maker, Warner Chilcott, and relocate its headquarters abroad, striking one of the first big so-called inversions.

Actavis’s deal to move abroad and reduce its tax bill caught the attention of other drug companies and set off a rush of similar deals. Soon the exodus of big corporations was drawing scorn from regulators in Washington, and in September the Treasury Department passed new rules to make it harder for companies that strike inversions to save on taxes.

But because Actavis had already completed its move abroad, it was exempt from the new Treasury rules and will be able to pay lower taxes on Allergan’s international sales. Actavis already took advantage of its newfound financial flexibility as an Irish company this year when it acquired Forest Laboratories.

In an indication of the financial benefits of its move to Ireland, Actavis said its effective tax rate would be about 15 percent after the deal closed, well below the statutory corporate tax rate in the United States.

Actavis is offering a significantly higher price than Valeant and Mr. Ackman’s firm, Pershing Square Capital Management, could muster. In April, they opened their bidding for Allergan at $47 billion. A series of raises brought their offer to a current value of about $53 billion.

And in a recent letter to Allergan’s board, Mr. Pearson said his group could offer cash and stock worth up to $200 a share if Allergan would come to the bargaining table.

But Actavis’s offer of $219 a share appears to put Allergan out of reach for Valeant and Pershing Square. Shares of Allergan rose $10.55, or 5.3 percent, to $209.20, still below the takeover price.

The Actavis deal is something of a vindication for Allergan’s chief executive, David E. I. Pyott. For much of the year, he and Allergan’s board had been under attack from analysts, investors and shareholder advisory firms for resisting the approaches by Valeant and Pershing Square. Allergan sought to prevent the two from nominating directors to replace the Allergan board and sued them in federal court in California.

A main argument Mr. Pyott made for the resistance was that Valeant was a fundamentally unsound company, built on a rapid series of acquisitions with little underlying growth. He also assailed Valeant’s reputation for sharply reducing spending on research and development. For these reasons, Mr. Pyott said, it would be irresponsible to sell the company for compensation consisting largely of Valeant stock.

For Valeant and Pershing Square, the sale of Allergan to Actavis will not be not a total loss. Mr. Ackman’s firm owns 9.7 percent of Allergan and will profit handsomely.

“Today’s transaction provides Allergan stockholders with substantial and immediate value, as well as the opportunity to participate in the significant upside potential of the combined company,” Mr. Pyott said in a statement. “We are combining with a partner that is ideally suited to realize the full potential inherent in our franchise. Together with Actavis, we are poised to extend the Allergan growth story as part of a larger organization with a broad and balanced portfolio, a meaningful commitment to research and development, a strong pipeline and an unwavering focus on exceeding the expectations of patients and the medical specialists who treat them.”

Combining Actavis and Allergan will create one of the 10 largest global drug makers, with about $23 billion in revenue expected next year. Cost savings could total $1.8 billion annually, the companies said. The deal will combine Allergan’s blockbuster product, Botox, with a suite of Actavis drugs in areas like women’s health and dermatology.

Allergan stockholders will receive $129.22 in cash and 0.3683 of an Actavis share for each of their shares. The price represents about a 54 percent premium to Allergan’s price before Valeant and Pershing Square began their takeover effort and is more than double the share price a year ago.

In a call with investors, Actavis management said it would keep spending on research and development, contrasting Valeant’s pledges to reduce research spending.

“We are committed to R.&D.,” said Brent Saunders, the chief executive of Actavis. “It is the lifeblood of our company.”

Despite losing out on his bid to help acquire the company, Mr. Ackman’s fund will reap a profit of $2.6 billion on its 9.7 percent stake in Allergan. It will share 15 percent of that, or about $389 million, with Valeant, which trumpeted its future prospects.

“Our business is performing extremely well, as evidenced by our third-quarter results, our expected strong fourth quarter and our robust outlook for 2015, and I am confident in our continued ability to generate exceptional shareholder value,” Mr. Pearson said.

Pershing Square did not immediately comment on the agreement between Actavis and Allergan.

Financially Compelling Transaction

Actavis continues to expect the transaction to generate double-digit accretion to non-GAAP earnings within the first 12 months, including approximately $1.8 billion in operating and financial synergies to be realized within one year following the close.  These synergies exclude any additional revenue or manufacturing synergies, and are in addition to the $475 million of annual savings previously announced by Allergan in connection with Project Endurance.  Actavis further expects to generate strong operating cash flow in excess of $8 billion in 2016, which would enable the Company to rapidly de-lever the balance sheet. 

Review of the Benefits of the Acquisition

The combination of Actavis and Allergan creates a pharmaceutical business with a growth profile unparalleled within the industry.

Significantly Expanded Brand Pharmaceutical Portfolio Supported by a World-Class Sales and Marketing Organization

The close of the transaction creates an exceptional global brand pharmaceutical business with leading positions in key therapeutic categories.  The company has six blockbuster franchises with combined pro forma 2015 revenues of approximately $15 billion expected, including franchises with annual revenues in excess of $3 billion in Eye Care, Neurosciences/CNS and Medical Aesthetics/Dermatology/Plastic Surgery, as well as a portfolio of world-renowned brands including BOTOX®, RESTASIS®, JUVEDERM®, NAMENDA XR®, LINZESS® and LO LOESTRIN® Fe among others.

The combined company will continue to be recognized for its strong commitment as the partner of choice with physicians, specialists, pharmacists, regulators and patients. The combination is committed to creating the best customer experience, based on deeply-held relationships with customers and colleagues in approximately 100 countries around the world. The company's experienced  sales and marketing organization will continue to deliver exceptional support to more than a dozen medical specialists, including primary care physicians, ophthalmologists, optometrists, retinal specialists, neurologists, psychiatrists, dermatologists, aesthetic surgeons, medical aesthetic professionals, plastic surgeons, gastroenterologists, pulmonologists, OB-GYNs,  urologists, cardiologists, infectious disease specialists, pain specialists and rehabilitation specialists.

Enhanced Commercial Opportunities across Global Markets

The combination greatly enhances Actavis' international commercial opportunities.  The company has an expanded commercial presence now including approximately 100 countries, with an enhanced presence across Canada, Europe, Southeast Asia and Latin America and a strong footprint in China and India.  The combined company will benefit from Allergan's global brand equity, industry-leading consumer marketing capabilities and strong consumer awareness of key Allergan products in global markets, including BOTOX®, RESTASIS®, JUVEDERM®, LATISSE®, NATRELLE® and others.  On a pro forma basis, the company is expected to have approximately $5 billion in 2015 international revenue, and will have the unique opportunity to drive continued growth in international markets through its enhanced portfolio of brands, generics, branded-generic and over-the-counter products.

Strengthened and Expanded Pharmaceutical R&D Pipeline

The combined company will provide a strong commitment to R&D, with an exceptional level of investment of approximately $1.7 billion expected in 2015, focused on the strategic development of innovative and durable value-enhancing products within brands, generics, biologics and OTC portfolios. The company has more than 20 innovative products in near- or mid-term development, including Cariprazine, Eluxadoline, Esmya, Aczone X and Darpin AMD, among other promising candidates.  The company's pipeline is strategically focused within its core therapeutic areas, with key candidates in Dermatology and Aesthetics, Eye Care, CNS, GI, Anti-infectives, Women's Health and Urology.  The Company's generics pipeline is also positioned to deliver sustainable growth, with approximately 230 Abbreviated New Drug Applications pending at FDA, including approximately 70 first-to-file applications, as well as nearly 1,000 marketing authorization applications filed outside of the U.S. in 2014.

Commitment to Being the Partner of Choice for Physicians, Patients and the Medical Community

The combined company will retain Allergan's foundational commitment to being the partner of choice for physicians, patients and the medical community.  The Company will continue to foster deep engagement with medical specialists, listening closely to their needs to help advance patient care and deliver treatments that address significant unmet medical needs.  In addition, the Company will continue to go above and beyond to provide education and information - with the highest level of integrity - that helps patients fully understand the choices available to them and make well-informed treatment decisions with their doctors.   Through these essential partnerships, the Company will continue to bring to bear scientific excellence and rigor to deliver leading products that improve patient outcomes.

Strong Combined Global Leadership Team with Deep Experience across the Business

The combined company's expanded senior management team is comprised of leaders from both Actavis and Allergan.

“In fairness, we have a lot going on with the integrations, the deals, and people worried that our people can’t stay focused on executing in the business while we have all this stuff going on, and we keep proving quarter after quarter that that’s not true,” he said in a “Squawk Box” interview.

The drugmaker also announced that it will adopt the name Allergan after a deal to purchase the company for $66 billion closes.

“When you look at those two equities, both had lots of value, but Allergan really stood for innovation, it stood for customer focus, and that really describes I think the new company we are today better than Actavis,” Saunders said.

The acquisition is on track to close by early next quarter, he added.

The preference is to grow organically rather than through mergers and acquisitions, he said. Actavis has done about $100 billion of deals in the past year alone.

However, Saunders declined to say what percentage of revenue the company would allocate to research and development, saying that metric is “horrible” and has gotten big pharma in a lot of trouble.

“If you spend just as a percentage of revenue, what happens? You then put junk into the pipeline to get up to that number, or you have great projects to go after, but you can’t do it because you don’t want to go over that number,” he said. “Why can’t you just spend against things that make sense?”

The company will invest about $1.7 billion into research and development next year, he said.

He urged investors to look at the number of products coming out and the productivity of the money spent on those releases.

Actavis’s fourth quarter earnings were helped by higher sales of its branded drugs in North America.

The company’s net loss widened to $732.9 million, or $2.76 per share, in the fourth quarter that ended Dec. 31 from $148.4 million, or 86 cents per share, a year earlier.

However, on an adjusted basis the company earned $3.91 per share. Analysts on average had expected $3.67, according to Thomson Reuters.

Net revenue rose 46 percent to $4.06 billion. Total North American brands revenue nearly tripled to $1.83 billion.",

#us-modal-rAp7M Shares of Actavis plc surged by as much as 6% during regular trading hours today, while Allergan, Inc. stock edged upward by nearly 2%
This week Actavis plc (NYSE:ACT[1]) and Allergan, Inc. (NYSE:AGN[2]) officially announced their merger deal, and analysts are starting to weigh in. The $219 per share acquisition deal Actavis made for Allergan was too rich for Valeant Pharmaceuticals Intl Inc (NYSE:VRX[3]) (TSE:VRX[4])'s blood, so the company has declared that it is ending its hostile pursuit[5] of Allergan.
 
Buy ratings on Allergan, Actavis reiterated
In their report dated Nov. 17, 2014, Deutsche Bank analysts Gregg Gilbert and Greg Fraser said they see 'significant upside' for both Actavis plc (NYSE:ACT[6]) and Allergan, Inc. (NYSE:AGN[7]) based on the deal[8]. It's worth about $67 billion in cash and stock and is expected to close in the second quarter of 2015, assuming that it gets the approval of shareholders and regulators.
http://cdn1.valuewalk.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/Actavis-logo.jpg
They believe the combination of the two drug makers makes a ''best-in-breed' company with strong generic and branded franchises, geographic diversity, and very solid management.' They reiterated their Buy ratings on both companies, along with their price targets of $277 per share[9] for Actavis plc (NYSE:ACT[10]) and $217 per share for Allergan, Inc. (NYSE:AGN[11]). Those price targets are based on each drug maker's standalone prospects.
Their updated analysis suggests that there will be meaningful earnings per share and discounted cash flow accretion. Their discounted cash flow valuation for Actavis is now $327, an increase of 32% compared to their standalone target. As for Allergan, they think shares could be trading at around $287 when the deal closes, delivering a total consideration to the Botox maker's shareholders of about $235 per share.
What happened after the announcement?
In their report also dated Nov. 17, 2014, Bernstein analysts Aaron Gal, Erica Kazlow and Wimal Kapadia noted that Actavis plc (NYSE:ACT[12]) shares reacted negatively[13] right after the announcement about the deal. They wondered why that happened and reported a number of issues investors raised.
For example, investors expressed concerns that's Allergan value captured most of the synergies. The Bernstein team also expected that the sideways trading was due to 'risk-arb organization repositioning.' Additionally, they believe investors were a bit confused about the use of convertible bonds. They also believe that there were questions about the combined company's long term growth trend, doubts about the projected revenue synergies and concerns about whether Actavis was growing on its own.
Of course it looks like investors are over these concerns, as Actavis shares have performed very strongly during regular trading today. Looking at the projections, the Bernstein analysts believe that the implied value of the stock is $330 per share.
Actavis could hit $300 or $400 a share
In their report dated Nov. 17, 2014, Sterne Agee analysts Shibani Malhotra and Austin Nelson said they think the accretion targets are 'totally achievable.' They think that when the dust settles, Actavis plc (NYSE:ACT[14]) stock could hit $300 or even $400 per share.
They note that since the deal is friendly, unlike the hostile bid[15] from Valeant Pharmaceuticals, integration should be seamless. They also see Actavis plc (NYSE:ACT[16]) as being well positioned to speed up the combined entity because CEO Brent Saunders has the experience necessary to drive long term value.

(together, ""Actavis""). The proceeds will be used to help fund the cash portion of the previously announced acquisition of Allergan Inc. (A3, review for downgrade). There are no changes to the existing ratings of Actavis and its related subsidiaries. The outlook is stable.

Ratings assigned:

New senior unsecured notes, at Baa3

RATINGS RATIONALE

The Baa3 rating reflects Actavis' significant scale, diversity, and cash generation ability following the close of the acquisition of Allergan, expected to occur within the next several weeks. The combined company will generate over $22 billion of revenue, will have very good diversity by therapeutic area and product, and no significant patent ""cliff"" risk. The company's combined product pipeline, including a number of recently approved products, also gives Actavis a healthy organic growth outlook.

The rating is constrained by the significant increase in debt that Actavis will incur to fund the Allergan acquisition, which will result in a meaningful increase in leverage. Further, the rating is constrained by Actavis' aggressive acquisition appetite -- Allergan will mark the fourth ""transformational"" acquisition within the last several years. The pace of major acquisitions is concerning because of the potential for operating disruption, loss of management focus, and oversight of an increasingly complex, rapidly evolving organization. While Moody's believes that Actavis will not engage in any other transformational acquisitions over the next 12 months, it will continue to pursue smaller acquisitions, which could slow the pace of debt repayment.

Moody's anticipates that adjusted debt/EBITDA will decline to around 4.0x within one year of the acquisition owing largely to the realization of cost savings as well as debt repayment. Actavis will generate a significant amount of cash, and Moody's believes that a substantial portion of this cash will be used to repay debt over the next 12 months.

Moody's could downgrade Actavis' ratings if the company encounters significant integration challenges or a deterioration in operating performance due to increased competition on key branded franchises, significant margin pressure in the generic pharmaceutical business or significant quality or legal issues. Use of a material amount of free cash flow for purposes other than debt repayment over the next 12 months or additional debt-funded acquisitions could also lead to a downgrade. Specifically, if Actavis is unable or unwilling to reduce debt/EBITDA to below 4.0x within 12-18 months following close of the Allergan acquisition, ratings could be downgraded.

Moody's could upgrade Actavis' ratings if the company successfully integrates Forest and Allergan, realizes most of its anticipated synergies, and uses free cash flow to repay debt. Key to an upgrade would be reduced risk of large acquisitions such that Moody's believes debt/EBITDA will be sustained below 3.0x.

Headquartered in Dublin, Ireland, Actavis, plc (NYSE: ACT) is one of the world's largest generic pharmaceutical companies. Actavis also has a growing specialty branded drug business, as well as a generic drug distribution business (""Anda"").

The deal, if completed, would not only create a pharmaceutical behemoth but would be a rarity in the current financial tumult: a big acquisition that is not a desperate merger of two banks orchestrated by the government.

It will also be the first big merger backed by Wall Street in months. While credit has been notoriously tight of late, five banks have agreed to lend Pfizer $22.5 billion to pay for the deal. Pfizer, which has roughly $26 billion in cash, would finance the remainder through a combination of cash and stock.

If completed as planned, the transaction would be the biggest merger since AT&T and BellSouth combined in a $70 billion deal in March 2006, according to the research firm Capital IQ.

Pfizer also said Monday that its net income for the fourth quarter dropped 90 percent from the period a year ago, citing a charge to resolve inquires into its off-label promotional practices. In its statement, it also said that it planned to its work force by about 10 percent and reduce the number of manufacturing sites. The company also said that it would cut its dividend.

Pfizer earned $268 million, or 4 cents a share, in the fourth quarter, down from $2.72 billion, or 40 cents a share, in the period a year ago. Revenue dropped 4 percent, to $12.35 billion. Excluding the $2.3 billion to settle the marketing inquiry, Pfizer had a profit of 65 cents a share. Analysts surveyed by Thomson Reuters had forecast 59 cents.

“The combination of Pfizer and Wyeth will meaningfully deliver Pfizer’s strategic priorities in a single transaction,” the Pfizer’s chief executive, Jeffrey B. Kindler, said in a statement Monday. “Our combined company will be one of the most diversified in the industry and will benefit from complementary patient-centric units that match speed with the benefits of a global company’s scale and resources.”

The merger almost came unhinged at the 11th hour. While the boards of both companies agreed to the broad outlines of the deal and its price before the weekend, these people said, one issue was still a sticking point: whether Pfizer would be allowed to back out of the deal if the economy worsened or Wyeth’s prospects faded.

In better times, deals often falter on matters of strategy or price. But in this case, because of the ailing economy, Pfizer has agreed to pay a staggering breakup fee, $4.5 billion, if it does not complete the deal under certain circumstances  if, for example, its credit rating drops and it can no longer finance the deal. That is almost twice the typical breakup fee for a deal of this size.",

One of the world's biggest pharmaceutical companies is set to get even larger. Pfizer announced on 26 January that it intends to acquire Wyeth, a company with a strong reputation in biologics and vaccines.

The combined company — united under the name Pfizer — would be a behemoth, with nearly 130,000 employees and more than US$71 billion in revenue. Pfizer will pay about $68 billion for Wyeth, based in Madison, New Jersey, an unusually large deal given the current financial crisis. The acquisition, expected to close late this year, will draw on Pfizer's cash and stock resources, along with a loan of $22.5 billion, backed by a syndicate of five banks, some of which recently received bail-out funds from the US government.

The deal comes as Pfizer nears the expiry dates of its patents on several key drugs, including atorvastatin (Lipitor), a cholesterol medication that is the best-selling drug in the world.

Over the past two years, Pfizer has shed 16,000 employees, closed 15 manufacturing sites, and culled research programmes (see Nature 456, 6–7; 2008). The company now says it intends to cut 19,500 more jobs, losing 15% of its workforce. This includes 8,000 job losses announced before the Wyeth purchase.

Both Wyeth and Pfizer have strong research programmes in diseases of the central nervous system, such as Alzheimer's disease, and in animal health-care products. But Pfizer chief executive Jeffrey Kindler says that the Wyeth acquisition will diversify Pfizer's pipeline, particularly in vaccines and in biologics — drugs comprised of complex biological molecules.

In the short term, Wyeth can bolster Pfizer's portfolio with two top-selling products. The pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (Prevnar) against meningitis in infants and children is the world's best-selling vaccine, and etanercept (Enbrel) — an arthritis and psoriasis therapy that Wyeth markets with Amgen of Thousand Oaks, California — is the world's best-selling biologic. Wyeth's expertise in developing and manufacturing biologics is particularly enticing: biologics can bring in large revenues and are more difficult to copy as generic drugs. As a result, pharmaceutical companies that have traditionally relied on small-molecule drugs are now trying to bolster their expertise in biologics.

But in the past, Pfizer's large acquisitions were blamed for slowing productivity and damaging employee morale. 'Mega-mergers' between large, mature pharmaceutical companies have an uneven track record, says Gary Pisano, a professor at the Harvard Business School in Boston, Massachusetts. ""It's hard to think of how a merger of two companies that have been struggling with their pipeline performance will lead to a more innovative company,"" he says. ""The data are pretty clear that when companies go through that, often innovative performance declines.""

At a press conference on 26 January, Kindler acknowledged this legacy, but maintained that Pfizer is a very different company now. Recent restructuring has created smaller, more focused research units and streamlined manage­ment, both of which may guard against the organizational chaos that resulted from past acquisitions, he says. ""We obviously have learned a lot from our prior acquisitions,"" he says. ""This is very, very different from prior large pharmaceutical mergers."" ",

Thursday, October 15, 2009 - 2:31pm

(BUSINESS WIRE)--Pfizer Inc (NYSE: PFE) today announced that it has combined operations with Wyeth following the closing of the acquisition yesterday. Pfizer is now a more diversified health care company, with product offerings in human, animal, and consumer health, including vaccines, biologics, small molecules and nutrition across the developed and emerging markets. It has medicines in numerous growing therapeutic areas, a robust pipeline, premier scientific and manufacturing capabilities and a leading global presence.

“Pfizer’s newly strengthened company will have some of the best assets, people, pipeline and capabilities in the industry,” said Jeffrey B. Kindler, chairman and chief executive officer of Pfizer. “We have a clear responsibility to turn those strengths into meaningful results for patients, customers and the communities we serve, as well as for our shareholders. We will measure our success through our company’s new commitments, which include advancing wellness, prevention, treatments and cures that serve the world’s diverse health needs, while maximizing our financial performance.

“We are pleased to welcome our talented new colleagues from Wyeth to Pfizer, including many first-class scientists and business leaders,” Mr. Kindler added. “We are proud that our new and existing colleagues possess all of the highly valuable skills and experience essential to every aspect of our business, and share our passion for improving health and well-being at every stage of life.”

Operational Integration and Readiness

Since the acquisition agreement was announced in January, integration teams at Pfizer and Wyeth have worked diligently to ensure that the combined company is fully operational immediately upon the closing of the transaction. To further advance these objectives, Pfizer previously announced a new approach to research and development and an enhanced commercial operating structure, and named select leaders to posts that became effective upon closing of the acquisition. As a result of these actions, Pfizer will begin to capitalize on the benefits offered by the combination with Wyeth starting immediately.

“Our ability to close this transaction in such a timely manner and be operational on ‘Day One’ is a true testament to the dedication of the integration teams at both companies,” said Pfizer Chief Financial Officer Frank D’Amelio, who is leading the integration. “Because business continuity was our primary objective throughout the integration process, our leaders and colleagues are in a position to quickly build on Pfizer’s solid financial foundation, operational discipline and diverse product base to continue to improve our performance.”

Strengthened and Diversified Portfolio

Pfizer now has a broad and diversified global product portfolio, with leadership in virtually all key high-growth therapeutic areas. The combined company has strengthened capabilities in biotechnology, vaccines, consumer healthcare, nutrition and animal health. Pfizer is well positioned for consistent and stable top-line and adjusted diluted EPSi growth over the short and long term. It is expected that no drug will account for more than 10 percent of the combined company’s revenue in 2012.

The combined company has a robust and growing pipeline of biopharmaceutical development projects to help patients in critical areas, including Alzheimer’s disease, oncology, pain, neuroscience, diabetes and inflammation. The combination of top scientists from both companies, as well as leading scientific and manufacturing capabilities, and a global network of proof-of-concept clinical development centers, has greatly enhanced the company’s ability to innovate.

Flexible, Patient-Centric Global Operating Structure

Pfizer will now operate through its patient-centric business units in human health as well as through its animal health, consumer and nutrition businesses that match the speed and agility of small, focused enterprises with the benefits of a global organization’s scale and resources. These businesses are organized into two groups to allow their leadership to identify opportunities and address challenges that exist across the business units and better align corporate priorities. The Biopharmaceuticals Business units are Emerging Markets, Established Products, Oncology, Primary Care and Specialty Care, which includes vaccines. The Diversified Businesses are Animal Health, Capsugel, Consumer Healthcare and Nutrition.

Pfizer also now has two distinct research and development organizations to maximize new opportunities in biopharmaceutical research. The PharmaTherapeutics Research & Development group focuses on the discovery of small molecules and related modalities, and the BioTherapeutics Research & Development group focuses on large-molecule research, including vaccines. The individual units within these two research organizations are led by world-class Chief Scientific Officers, who act as single points of accountability for delivering positive proofs-of-concept for Pfizer’s businesses to develop.

Pfizer also now has a significantly strengthened global footprint in the United States, Europe, Asia and Latin America, and has an enhanced ability to help patients in key emerging markets such as China and the Middle East.

Pfizer is now in the process of finalizing the decisions related to talent and site matters and will work quickly to effectively implement those decisions. Talent and site decisions are subject to works council and/or union consultations and other legal requirements, as applicable.

Financial Highlights

The acquisition is expected to be accretive to Pfizer’s adjusted diluted earnings per share1 in the second full year after closing. The transaction is anticipated to yield synergies of approximately $4 billion by the end of 2012. These synergies, which are in addition to the approximately $2 billion in net annual cost savings that we plan to achieve by the end of 2011 apart from the Wyeth acquisition, are expected in selling, informational and administrative functions, research and development, and manufacturing.

The Wall Street Journal reported Friday that the companies have been in talks for months, but said any deal is far from completion and the state of the global markets could undo any plans. Neither company was talking Friday.

If a deal goes through, the world's biggest drugmaker would see its revenue jump 50 percent and its profit climb, would vault into a premier position in two areas it's been coveting biotech drugs and vaccines and could slash costs with another round of job cuts in areas with significant overlap, from administration to research.

What are the chances a deal will close?

""""I'd say maybe better than 50-50,"""" said analyst Les Funtleyder of Miller Tabak & Co.

Analysts say Pfizer, the maker of impotence drug Viagra and overactive bladder treatment Detrol, needs to do something dramatic to compensate for a revenue crash starting in November 2011. That's when the world's top-selling drug, $13 billion-a-year cholesterol fighter Lipitor, is expected to face generic competition.

At $60 billion, a deal between New York-based Pfizer and No. 12 drugmaker Wyeth of Madison, N.J., would be slightly less than the $66 billion Sanofi-Aventis merger from August 2004. Coincidentally, $60 billion is the same price Pfizer paid for its last big acquisition, Pharmacia Corp., in April 2003, said Erik Gordon, biomedical analyst and professor at University of Michigan's Ross School of Business.

""""Part of this is a financial trick,"""" he added. Wyeth has much more debt than Pfizer proportionally, he explained, and under complex but standard accounting practices, the combination would boost Pfizer's earnings per share, possibly by 20 to 30 cents per share.

""""That obviously isn't driving the deal, but it's a bonus,"""" Gordon said.

Shares of Wyeth rose $4.91, or 12.6 percent, to $43.74. Pfizer shares were down most of the day but closed up 24 cents at $17.45.

Analysts said Friday that getting financing could be a big hurdle it would have to be a cash-and-stock deal, with Pfizer still likely to have to borrow billions and the Federal Trade Commission might require the companies to divest some products.

Pfizer Chief Executive Jeff Kindler, barely in the job for two years, had to take drastic action to get the company out of its doldrums: flat revenue, little to show for its $7.5 billion in yearly research spending and the expected loss of more than 70 percent of its 2007 revenue by 2015.

Its run of iconic blockbusters Viagra, Lipitor, antidepressant Zoloft, plus blood-pressure blockbuster Norvasc is a fading memory and its research labs have been so unproductive that it closed its mammoth research lab in Ann Arbor, Mich., about a year ago and now is laying off 800 more research staffers.

Lyrica for nerve pain and fibromyalgia is now a $2.5 billion-a-year product, but smoking cessation treatment Chantix hasn't lived up to expectations because of links to depression and suicidal thoughts. Perhaps worst of all, its high-profile effort to come up with a Lipitor successor flamed out when torcetrapib had to be axed in late-stage testing because it triggered heart problems. Last fall, Pfizer publicly conceded that failure when it eliminated all new research on heart disease, the world's top killer.

Pfizer's stock price is barely one-third of its July 2000 peak of $48.

Until now, the company has just been tinkering, cutting staff here, closing plants there and trimming its research portfolio.

Acquiring Wyeth would transform Pfizer almost overnight from primarily a pure pharmaceutical company into a broadly diversified health care giant, given Wyeth's huge presence and revenue in biotech drugs, vaccines including the blockbuster pneumococcal vaccine Prevnar, veterinary medicines and consumer health products from Advil to Robitussin.

Biotech drugs, produced in living cells, are seen as hot commodities these days because they generally command high prices and have little to no risk of generic competition. Wyeth's offerings include blockbuster rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel (sold jointly with Amgen Inc.), and hemophilia treatments Refacto, BeneFIX and Xyntha.

So is absorbing Wyeth Pfizer's best option? Analysts are all over the map on that issue.

""""Such an acquisition makes strategic and financial sense,"""" wrote Credit Suisse analyst Catherine Arnold, who has been supporting such a move since last March. """"This deal would instantly make (Pfizer) a top-tier biologics player,"""" boost cash flow and perhaps """"mark the beginning of a year of sector consolidation.""""

Krensavage Partners money manager Mike Krensavage was lukewarm: """"Wyeth is at an attractive enough price that I don't think Pfizer has too much to lose by pursuing this transaction.""""

Steve Brozak of WBB Securities was more critical.

""""This is a fix for the next 12 to 18 months. This still doesn't resolve the fundamental flaw in the large-pharma model,"""" he said, referring to companies relying on blockbusters and narrowing research rather than forging lots of partnerships with small biotech firms and academic researchers to develop as many compounds as possible. """"They're going to combine the two entities, eliminate redundancies and just focus on the bottom line earnings numbers, which doesn't work in the long run.""""

The two companies both announced last fall that they were trimming their research portfolios to fewer disease areas, and ended up with several that overlap: Alzheimer's disease, cancer, diabetes and related metabolic disorders, pain and inflammatory disorders such as arthritis. That could allow them to trim the least-promising drug compounds in each area, save research dollars and still have more possibilities in development.

Wyeth faces generic competition to its top seller, $3 billion-a-year antidepressant Effexor, in July 2010. Heartburn drug Protonix got generic competition last year, when antibiotic Zosyn also lost patent protection, but that drug still has no generic competitors.

In any case, Wyeth's fortunes don't depend as heavily on any one drug as Pfizer's do on Lipitor, and most of its revenue now comes from biotech drugs, vaccines and veterinary medicines, not chemically synthesized pills.

Wyeth got three drugs approved last year antidepressant Pristiq, Relistor for constipation caused by narcotic painkillers, and the hemophilia drug Xyntha ending a grinding stretch where the increasingly cautious Food and Drug Administration repeatedly shot down its applications or demanded more information.

And Wyeth's stable of consumer products including household names such as Chap Stick, Centrum vitamins, pain reliever Anacin and Preparation H is nearly as valuable as the iconic brands Pfizer sold to Johnson & Johnson three years ago when it chose to get out of consumer health and focus on pharmaceuticals. Many analysts have called that a mistake.

With a wave of patent expirations hitting most big drugmakers over the next few years, Pfizer, Wyeth and plenty of competitors have been slashing jobs and other costs. Pfizer is widely expected to announce plans to eliminate one-third of its sales force when it announces fourth-quarter earnings next Wednesday, the day before Wyeth releases its results.

It employs 5,000 in the Phila. Region.",,"""A $60 billion purchase of drugmaker Wyeth by rival Pfizer Inc. is not a certainty, but if it does happen, it could lead to thousands of job cuts throughout Wyeth, including at its extensive Philadelphia-area operations.

No one from the two pharmaceutical companies would comment yesterday on reports of ongoing acquisition talks. Industry observers said Pfizer was desperate to do a deal to replace the billions in sales it would lose when the patent on its blockbuster cholesterol drug, Lipitor, expired in two years.

Making a deal profitable would demand steep job cuts at both companies, these analysts said. Cuts likely would fall more heavily on Wyeth, which employs 47,000 people worldwide, 5,000 at facilities in Malvern and Collegeville.

""""They're slash-and-burn. To be taken over by Pfizer is not a fun thing,"""" said Peter Rost, a former Pfizer vice president who was fired after accusing the company of marketing its drugs for unapproved uses and is campaigning to head the Food and Drug Administration.

Daniel Hoffman, who runs a pharmaceutical-research firm in Glenmoore, Chester County, said several factors would drive pressures to cut costs. Generic drugs, a weakening economy, and likely health-care changes already have put drug companies in a bind.

""""Generally, in this kind of deal, you would be looking at 25 to 30 percent cost reduction,"""" Hoffman said, """"but here it's going to be more like 50 percent.""""

Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. Inc. analyst Timothy Anderson predicted that Pfizer would cut 70 percent of Wyeth's current $10 billion budget for research and development, and for marketing and administrative expenses.

He based his estimates on an eventual sale price of $65 billion.

At the Wyeth Pharmaceuticals campus in Malvern yesterday, workers, most of whom declined to give their names, said they had heard almost nothing.

""""It's just wait and see,"""" one man said as he walked from one of the two red-brick-and-glass buildings to the parking lot. """"There's very little information, so there is nothing to comment on."""" A woman said she viewed the news as positive because it offered opportunities to innovate.

Wyeth, based in Madison, N.J., completed a 7 percent reduction in its workforce late last year. Pfizer, based in New York, employs 83,400. The company has cut 15,000 jobs since January 2007 and is in the process of cutting more.

The harsh conditions in the pharmaceutical industry resonate deeply at Pfizer because of the approaching expiration of the patent on Lipitor.

The best-selling cholesterol drug accounts for almost 25 percent of Pfizer's revenue, which was $48.4 billion in 2007. The company has developed few of its own top-selling drugs and has relied on acquisitions for new products.

Wyeth, which makes Prevnar, a popular pneumococcal vaccine, as well as Robitussin and other consumer products, could give Pfizer a steadier source of sales.

""""Theoretically, this is the best of the three bad options Pfizer had,"""" said Les Funtleyder, an analyst with Miller Tabak + Co. L.L.C. and author of Healthcare Investing. """"They could buy something big, buy a bunch of small things, or do nothing and let Lipitor go off patent.""""

In 2000, Pfizer bought Warner-Lambert for $116 billion because it made Lipitor. Analysts have roundly criticized Pfizer over the years, saying it paid too much in that deal and for other acquisition mistakes.

Pfizer cut ruthlessly after the Warner-Lambert deal, said Rost, the former Pfizer vice president.

After several years of eliminating jobs that once totaled 3,600 at that company's Ann Arbor, Mich., facility, Pfizer announced its closing in January 2007. Among those put out of work was Bob Sliskovic, a scientist credited with developing Lipitor.

Rumors of a Pfizer acquisition of Wyeth or another company have been circulating for months. The Wall Street Journal confirmed talks yesterday. Pfizer is expected to use a combination of cash, stock and debt if it completes the deal. Carol Levenson, an analyst with the research firm Gimme Credit L.L.C., said the acquisition could damage Pfizer's credit outlook.

""""We don't see why Wyeth is a solution to Pfizer's problems - it has plenty of lingering legal and patent-expiration problems of its own,"""" she said in a note to clients. Wyeth last year lost patent protection on the antibiotic Zosyn and the heartburn drug Protonix.

Analysts said a slight thaw in the credit markets recently might have pushed the talks forward.

Wyeth shares rose $4.91, or 12.6 percent, closing yesterday at $43.74.

Pfizer shares closed up 24 cents, at $17.45.

NEW YORK, Jan 26 (Reuters) - Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), the No. 1 drugmaker, said on Monday that it would acquire U.S. rival Wyeth WYE.N for about $68 billion in a move to diversify its revenue base.

The world’s largest drugmaker, which raised $22.5 billion in debt from a consortium of banks to finance the deal, also cut its dividend.

The deal helps Pfizer cope with a major gap in revenue in 2011, when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment will begin to face U.S. generic competition. Next year, Wyeth loses patent protection on its own top drug, the anti-depressant Effexor XR.

Still, the deal would help Pfizer diversify into vaccines and injectable biologic medicines by adding Wyeth’s big-selling Prevnar vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Pfizer would also realize major cost savings by streamlining areas that overlap.

For each share of Wyeth, Pfizer will pay roughly $50.19 — $33 in cash and 0.985 of a share of its stock.

Based on Wyeth’s 1.33 billion shares outstanding as of Oct. 31, the deal would be valued at about $66.8 billion. Including Wyeth’s stock options, the deal would be worth $68 billion, sources said.

At $50.19 per share, the deal would mark a 15 percent premium over Wyeth’s closing stock price of $43.74 on Friday. Wyeth’s stock had surged 12.6 percent on Friday on news of the possible deal.

The deal is expected to add to Pfizer’s adjusted diluted earnings per share in the second full year after closing and to result in cost savings of $4 billion by the third year.

CONSOLIDATION WAVE?

A merger of Pfizer and Wyeth could trigger a wave of consolidation in the cash-rich pharmaceutical sector as drugmakers look to diversify revenues in the face of competition from generic-drug rivals, analysts said.

“The outlook for the industry has steadily waned, (with) industry P/E multiples declining under the combined onslaught of price pressure, aggressive generic competition and low R&D productivity,” Deutsche Bank analysts said in a note.

“The result is that many leading companies face a decline in revenues and earnings next decade, as profitable products reach the end of their patented lives and are not replaced by new drugs,” the analysts said.

They said AstraZeneca (AZN.L) could be a target, although there were also reasons a deal might not happen.

In sealing the Pfizer deal, Wyeth went ahead and ended talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell CRCL.AS. Crucell shares plummeted 21.1 percent to 12.23 euros. [ID:nLQ120204]

The deal is subject to Pfizer’s financing sources not backing out due to a material adverse change in Pfizer’s financial health or due to the company’s failure to maintain a certain credit rating. Pfizer and Wyeth expect the transaction to close at the end of the third quarter or during the fourth quarter 2009.

But Pfizer shares slumped 10 percent and the cost of insuring its debt rose to an all-time high on concern about the additional debt and likely credit-rating downgrades.

Pfizer has long touted a hefty dividend to keep investors happy while it develops new drugs. But to do the deal, Pfizer slashed its dividend to 16 cents per share, effective with its second-quarter payout.

The dividend had led the industry, although the company maintains it still remains competitive with other drugmakers.

""People who owned it for the dividend got slapped in the head with a two-by-four today,"" said Mike Krensavage, principal with Krensavage Asset Management.

The blockbuster purchase planned by the world's largest drugmaker would reshape the pharmaceutical industry, while thawing a merger climate frozen by the global credit crisis.

Pfizer, which also forecast disappointing 2009 profit, said it would cut 15 percent of the combined company's workforce of about 130,000 employees and close some manufacturing sites -- adding to the job cuts sweeping through corporate America.

The New York-based company agreed to pay $50.19 -- $33 in cash and 0.985 share of its stock -- for each Wyeth share. That represents a 29 percent premium over Wyeth's closing share price last Thursday, before news of the talks began to leak.

Wyeth shares dipped 0.8 percent to close at $43.39 on Monday -- well below the offer price. The shares of Pfizer, which secured $22.5 billion in funding from a consortium of banks to help pay for the deal, fell 10.3 percent to $15.65.

""Given that there is a sizable amount of debt financing that has to occur, you would expect more risk to be built in,"" said David Moskowitz, an analyst with Caris & Co.

Indeed, the megadeal comes amid a merger drought, as tight credit markets make borrowing costly and difficult. Analysts said the fact that Pfizer had secured a large amount of financing was a positive signal.

""Deals of this quality and this magnitude will rekindle enthusiasm and hope about equity markets,"" said Andre Bakhos, president of Princeton Financial Group. ""In the midst of a global recession, here is Pfizer, hopefully spending their dollars wisely.""

Coping with Lipitor loss

The acquisition -- the third-largest in the drug industry since 1998 -- would help Pfizer cope with a major gap in revenue in 2011, when its blockbuster Lipitor cholesterol treatment will begin to face US generic competition. The company now says its earnings for 2012 should perhaps be about 20 percent above what Wall Street expected.

""Investors have been rightfully concerned about when Lipitor goes off patent,"" said Pfizer CEO Jeff Kindler. ""Today's announcement definitively addresses that.""

The deal would help Pfizer diversify into vaccines and injectable biologic medicines by adding Wyeth's big-selling Prevnar vaccine for childhood infections and Enbrel rheumatoid arthritis treatment. Both areas are seen as more immune than traditional pills to generic competition.

Pfizer also adds Wyeth's consumer health business that includes Advil painkillers more than two years after selling its own consumer health unit to Johnson & Johnson.

Pfizer typifies many large drugmakers, which have struggled to produce new blockbusters to replace those on which they lose exclusivity.

Wyeth itself loses patent protection next year on its own top drug, the antidepressant Effexor XR.

The deal is expected to boost Pfizer's earnings in the second full year after closing and result in cost savings of $4 billion by the third year. Pfizer is reducing its manufacturing sites to 41 from 46 facilities.

""An acquisition of this nature can be valuable if management recognizes how rich their spending is and really cuts to maximize the profitability of the new organization,"" said Michael Castor, portfolio manager with Sio Capital Management. ""$4 billion in cuts is a good first step.""

Consolidation wave?

The deal could trigger a wave of consolidation in the cash- rich pharmaceutical sector as drugmakers look to diversify revenue sources in the face of competition from generic-drug rivals, analysts said.

In sealing the Pfizer deal, Wyeth withdrew from talks to buy Dutch vaccine firm Crucell. Crucell shares fell 12.6 percent.

Based on Wyeth's 1.33 billion shares outstanding as of October 31, the deal with Pfizer would be worth $66.8 billion; including Wyeth's stock options, it would be worth $68 billion.

The deal is subject to Pfizer's financing sources not backing out should the company's financial health suffer a material adverse change or should it fail to maintain a certain credit rating. Standard & Poor's said on Monday it might cut Pfizer's top ""AAA"" rating.

Wyeth would have to pay Pfizer a $1.8 billion break-up fee if it walks away from the deal, while Pfizer would have to pay Wyeth $4.5 billion if it does so, according to a source familiar with the deal.

Pfizer and Wyeth expect the deal to close at the end of the 2009 third quarter or during the fourth quarter. Analysts said there did not appear to be much risk of antitrust issues holding up the deal.

Pfizer was advised by Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Goldman Sachs, JPMorgan, Barclays and Citigroup Inc. Wyeth's financial advisers were Morgan Stanley and Evercore Partners Inc.

Pfizer also reported that fourth-quarter results suffered because of a higher tax rate, charges from cost-cutting and settlement costs from a probe by US authorities. The company earned $266 million, or 4 cents per share, on revenue of $12.35 billion.

Pfizer forecast adjusted earnings would fall at least 19 percent in 2009 as it takes a big tax hit for repatriating funds for the deal, whereas Wall Street was expecting slight growth.

Also on Monday, Wyeth posted fourth-quarter results that fell short of expectations. The company earned 71 cents a share on revenue of $5.35 billion, compared with the average Wall Street forecast of 79 cents a share on revenue of $5.79 billion, according to Reuters Estimates.

","Charter Communications offered Time Warner Cable less in a merger deal than was previously reported, $127 per share, and argued Tuesday the proposal is generous given ‘how bad things have become at Time Warner Cable.’

Executives from Stamford, Conn.-based Charter (Nasdaq: CHTR) criticized New York City-based Time Warner Cable’s performance under its current management, which has pursued a “failed operating strategy” for the past five years, they said.

The withering critique and new deal details — delivered in a Charter Communications Inc.conference call to shareholders in both companies and Wall Street analysts — was meant to explain Charter’s merger proposal, which it’s pursued with the backing of it’s largest investor, Douglas County-based Liberty Media Corp. (Nasdaq: LMCA).

Time Warner Cable has lost more than 800,000 video customers over the past year.

The deal Charter offered represents a 38 percent premium above Time Warner Cable’s trading price before the two companies held their only discussion about the offer in early December and merger rumors drove up Time Warner’s previously sagging stock price, Charter said.

The Charter Communications executives urged shareholders to push Time Warner management to consider the deal--and soon.

“We’re wholly financed, we’re ready to go and we have been for a long time,” said Christopher Winfrey, Charter Communications CFO. “Time is wasting.”

Charter Communications offered $127 a share, $82.54 of which would be in cash and the remainder would come in the form of shares in the new company that would amount to 45 percent ownership in the new company for Time Warner Cable’s shareholders. Charter Communications suggested to Time Warner Cable (Nasdaq: TWC) it could go as high as $132.50 per share — the figure reported broadly Monday — but that isn’t the company’s formal offer.

The financing is ready for either offer, Charter said. Time Warner Cable hasn't responded beyond saying it would be interested in a deal at a price higher “than a rational market player would reasonably expect, and well above what Charter would be willing to pay,” Winfrey said.

John Malone and Greg Maffei, Liberty Media’s chairman and CEO, respectively, are Charter Communications board members.

Liberty Media has said it wants to keep its 27 percent Charter ownership stake roughly the same following any deal. How Liberty would do that hasn’t been decided.

Liberty Media raised $1 billion in a debt offering in October. That’s in addition to the nearly $1.2 billion in cash on hand Liberty Media had in its last reported quarter; it also as funds to access from its Liberty Ventures investment arm.

Liberty Media's funds could be used as a deal sweetener in the cash portion of the offer to Time Warner Cable shareholders and maintain Liberty's equity stake.

“Whatever we do here likely is the premium to induce to [share]holders to vote for it and get the benefit of both worlds,” Maffei told investment analysts at a conference last week.

Liberty Media is trying buy the nearly 47 percent of Sirius XM Satellite Holdings Inc. that it doesn’t already own, which would make Sirius XM a wholly-owned subsidiary of Liberty Media.

Owning all of Sirius XM would improve Liberty Media’s cash flow and help raise money to invest in growth across its subsidiaries, not just to consolidate cable TV.

“I think it’s broader than just saying — as some have speculated — it means we’re going to go do a bid for another cable company,” Maffei said.

Charter CEO Thomas Rutledge, a veteran cable executive with experience at Time Warner Cable, Cablevision and other companies before Charter Communications, said there are several opportunities for deals in the industry.

Combining Charter and Time Warner would create a 20 million-subscriber juggernaut in video, vaulting it over Douglas County-based Dish Network Corp, the satellite TV company, to being the No. 3 U.S. pay-TV industry player. Turning around a cable operation of Time Warner's scale held the most growth potential for Charter, Rutledge said.

That’s largely because of how Time Warner Cable has fallen, and the prospects to improve it by investing in better broadband infrastructure.

“We saw an asset that could grow fast and take back [market] share from satellite and phone companies and have a better chance at fighting the real structural headwinds that cable companies face today, which is programming costs,” Rutledge said.

Charter sees as much as $750 million in annual operating cost-savings in a combined Charter-Time Warner after the two companies were integrated. Charter would also explore trading markets with other cable companies to create more logical, efficient geographic clusters of cable systems, too, Charter executives said.

But making Time Warner Cable grow the way Charter has in the past 18 months would be a big task, Rutledge said. Overpaying for the merger wouldn’t be fair to existing Charter shareholders given the lower-risk growth the company already has, and the potential to do other deals.

Whether that logic sways Time Warner Cable shareholders and starts serious deal discussions remains to be seen.

Friendly negotiations between the two companies would be in sharp contrast to their acrimonious exchanges in 2013 and early 2014 that ended with Time Warner Cable rejecting unsolicited approaches by Charter and instead finding a white knight in Comcast.

While Charter has yet to make a formal offer, Time Warner Cable believes its smaller peer may be willing to make a bid that is more attractive compared with its takeover attempt two years ago, the people said.

Time Warner Cable also views Charter’s stock as a more valuable currency than it did last year given its stock performance since then, the people said. Charter shares are up 33 percent in the last 12 months. Time Warner Cable also is open to deals with companies other than Charter, the people added.

The sources asked not to be identified because the deliberations are confidential. Time Warner Cable and Charter both declined to comment.

Last Friday, Comcast abandoned its $45 billion offer for Time Warner Cable after U.S. regulators raised concerns that the merger would give Comcast an unfair advantage in the cable TV and Internet-based services market.

Analysts expecting Charter to pursue TWC have debated whether Charter would top its previous bid in an effort to secure a friendly deal, or, facing no rival buyer, try to get TWC for less.

Controlled by John Malone’s Liberty Media Corp LMCA.O, Charter had bid $37.3 billion or about $132.50 per share for TWC last year before being beaten by Comcast, whose all-stock deal was initially worth $158.82 per share.

Malone, a deal maker known as the “cable cowboy,” was asked in November whether he would pursue TWC if the Comcast deal fell through. “Hell yes,” he replied.

Charter was also part of the complicated Comcast deal that unraveled. It would have acquired control of subscribers divested by the merged company. Last month Charter also agreed to acquire Bright House Networks for $10.4 billion.

Time Warner Cable has the right of first refusal in the event of a Bright House sale, however, and it could see such a deal as a way to avoid being bought by Charter, analysts have said.

Earlier on Monday, the Wall Street Journal reported that Time Warner Cable had reached out to Cox Communications about a potential merger, a report that both companies later denied.",

The deal brings Dr. John Malone, a cable magnate during the 80s and 90s, back into the top echelon of cable providers. Malone orchestrated today’s deal as part of his plan to dramatically consolidate the American cable industry. Malone’s Liberty Broadband Corp. assisted in pushing the deal across the finish line with an extra $5 billion (supplied by three hedge funds) in Charter stock purchases.

The companies expect to win regulator approval and close the deal by the end of 2015.

“No one has ever had a better sense of the multichannel world than John [Malone],” Leo Hindery, a veteran cable-industry executive, told the Wall Street Journal. “Obviously he sees in Charter and Time Warner Cable a way to perpetuate a legacy that is unrivaled.”

But the man who may have made today’s deal ultimately possible was FCC chairman Tom Wheeler. Last week, he personally called cable executives at Charter and Time Warner Cable to reassure them the FCC was not against all cable mergers just because it rejected one involving Comcast and Time Warner Cable.

But Wheeler warned he would only approve deals that were in the public interest.

“In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient,” Mr. Wheeler said.

Consumer groups are wary.

“The cable platform is quickly becoming America’s local monopoly broadband infrastructure,” said Free Press Research Director S. Derek Turner. “Charter will have a tough time making a credible argument that consolidating local monopoly power on a nationwide basis will benefit consumers. Indeed, the issue of the cable industry’s power to harm online video competition, which is what ultimately sank Comcast’s consolidation plans, are very much at play in this deal.”

“Ultimately, this merger is yet another example of the poor incentives Wall Street’s quarterly-result mentality creates,” Turner added. “Charter would rather take on an enormous amount of debt to pay a premium for Time Warner Cable than build fiber infrastructure, improve service for its existing customers or bring competition into new communities.”

A panel of Wall Street analysts discusses the chances for Charter’s plan to buy Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks. Some analysts continue to frame regulator approval over video programming costs, while others argue broadband is the key issue the FCC and Justice Department will consider when reviewing the merger. From Bloomberg TV. (5:36)

A heavily indebted Charter Communications will not own the combined entity free and clear. At the close of the deal, Time Warner Cable shareholders will own up to 44% of the new company, Liberty Broadband up to 20%, Advance/Newhouse (Bright House) up to 14%. Charter itself will own just 22%, but will be able to leverage voting control over the entity with the help of Malone’s Liberty, which will get almost 25% of the voting power. That will give Charter just enough of a combined edge to control the destiny of “New Charter.”

As with the aborted deal with Comcast, lucrative golden parachutes are expected for Time Warner’s top executives who will be departing if the deal wins approval. In their place will be Charter Communications CEO Thomas Rutledge and a board compromised of 13 directors (including Rutledge himself). Seven directors will be appointed by independent directors serving on Charter’s board, two designated by Advance/Newhouse and three from Liberty Broadband, again giving Rutledge and Malone effective control.

Current Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks customers will see major changes if Charter follows through on its commitment to bring Charter’s way of doing business to both operators.

No More Analog Television

all digitalCharter told investors at today’s merger announcement it will accelerate the removal of all analog television signals on TWC and Bright House cable TV lineups to free capacity for faster Internet products, more HD channels, and “other advanced products.”

Time Warner Cable CEO Rob Marcus told investors earlier this month TWC was already well-positioned with excess spectrum from moving lesser-watched analog channels to digital service and using “Switched Digital Video,” a technology that conserves bandwidth by only sending certain cable channels into neighborhoods where customers are actively watching them. This allowed Time Warner Cable customers to avoid renting a cable box for lesser-watched, cable-connected televisions in the home.

Charter’s plan requires a cable box on every connected television, at an added cost. The standard lease rate for the digital decoder box is $6.99 per month, and those customers on the lowest basic tier will likely receive at least two devices for up to two years for free, or five years for customers on Medicaid. Customers who subscribe to higher tiers of service or premium channels may receive only one device for free for one year before the monthly lease rate applies. For a home with an average of three connected televisions, this will eventually cost an extra $21 a month. DVR boxes cost considerably more.

No More Modem Lease Fee, But Only Two Choices for Internet Service

The good news is Charter does not apply any modem lease fees and there is a good chance if you already purchased your own modem, Charter will continue to let you use it. The bad news is that if you were used to sticking with a lower-speed broadband tier to save money, those days are likely coming to an end. Charter’s “simplified” menu of broadband options cuts Time Warner’s six choices and Bright House’s five options to just two:

60/4Mbps for Spectrum Internet ($59.99)
100/5Mbps for Internet Ultra ($109.99)
Charter_Spectrum_Mobile_Internet-finalThis is likely to be a red flag for regulators concerned about broadband affordability. Although it is likely Charter may offer concessions by grandfathering existing Time Warner Cable and Bright House customers under their current plans, Charter has nothing comparable to Time Warner’s “Everyday Low Price Internet” for $14.99 a month or a 6Mbps Basic broadband alternative far less expensive than Charter’s entry-level Internet tier. Bright House customers are not likely to experience something similar. The entry-level 15Mbps broadband-only plan is $65 a month without a promotion, according to Bright House.

Charter is rumored to be testing speed boosts for those two tiers for deployment in areas where they face fiber competitors. The first phase would raise Spectrum speeds to 100/25Mbps and Ultra to 300/50Mbps with plans to further increase speeds when DOCSIS 3.1 arrives — likely to 300/50Mbps for Spectrum and 500/300 for Ultra, at least where Google Fiber, U-verse with GigaPower, and Verizon FiOS offers competition.

Recently, Charter has followed Time Warner Cable’s marketing script and is actively promoting the fact the company has no data caps on broadband service, but Charter had a history of loosely enforced “soft caps” for several years in the recent past, so we’re not convinced data caps are gone for good at Charter.

Pricing & Service

billCharter enjoys a higher rate of revenue per customer than either Time Warner or Bright House, which is a sign customers are paying more. It is likely Charter’s reduced menu of choices is responsible for this. Although customers do get a better advertised level of service, they are paying a higher price for it, with no downgrade options. Ancillary equipment rental fees for television set-top boxes are also a likely culprit.

Charter also tells investors its merger with Time Warner and Bright House will bring “manageable promotional rate step-ups and rate discipline” to both companies. That means Charter will likely be less generous offering promotions to new and existing customers. Like Time Warner and Bright House, Charter will gradually raise rates on customers coming off a promotion until they eventually reset a customer’s rates to the regular price. But while Time Warner, in particular, was receptive to putting complaining customers back on aggressively priced promotions after an old promotion ended, Charter is not.

Charter customers tell us the company’s customer service department is notoriously inconsistent and promotional rates and offers can vary wildly. For some, Charter only got aggressive on price after they turned in their cable equipment and closed their accounts.

As far as service is concerned, CEO Thomas Rutledge has managed significant improvements while at Charter. What used to rival Mediacom in Consumer Reports’ annual ranking of the worst cable companies in America is now ranked number nine (Bright House took fourth place, Time Warner Cable: 12th).

But the presence of Malone in this deal, even peripherally, is a major concern. Malone-run cable companies are notorious for massive rate increases and poor customer service. Sen. Al Gore routinely called his leadership style of Tele-Communications, Inc. (TCI), since sold to Comcast, the Darth Vader of a cable Cosa Nostra and Sen. Daniel Inouye from Hawaii once remarked in a Senate oversight hearing that Malone’s executives were a “bunch of thugs.”",

Charter Communications, the fourth largest cable provider in the US, has announced it is buying Time Warner Cable, the country’s second largest cable company, in a $55.3bn deal that will create a new giant in the cable industry and a close rival to Comcast, Time Warner’s last suitor.

The proposed merger comes as the US cable industry is attempting to consolidate arguing the shift to people watching TV via the internet is fundamentally altering their business. The deal has been rumored ever since the Federal Communications Commission (FCC), spurred on by activists concerned about creating a monopoly, torpedoed a merger between Time Warner and Comcast last month.

The FCC, which is also reviewing telecoms giant AT&T’s bid for DirecTV, the satellite broadcaster, immediately announced it would look at the proposed transaction. Analysts said the deal faces some of the same problems that ended Comcast’s bid for Time Warner, as well as new ones of its own.


If successful the merger will be a crowning achievement for John Malone, the 74-year-old billionaire who is Charter’s main backer. Charter is backed by Malone’s Liberty Broadband. Charter had been discussing a merger with Time Warner before Comcast made its move.

As part of the transaction, Charter also will merge with small operator Bright House Networks. The combined companies would have 24 million customers compared to Comcast’s 27 million. The company would be renamed New Charter.

“With our larger reach, we will be able to accelerate the deployment of faster internet speeds, state-of-the-art video experiences, and fully featured voice products, at highly competitive prices,” Charter’s chief executive, Thomas M. Rutledge, said on Tuesday in a statement.

But some analysts are skeptical that a deal will be done. Comcast’s courting of Time Warner collapsed after a year of intense criticism from activists concerned about the impact of consolidation on consumers. BTIG’s Rich Greenfield has argued that this merger could face many of the issues the scuppered Comcast’s bid had to deal with.

Greenfield wrote earlier this month that the companies would not have a strong case before regulators. “We believe it will be next to impossible for Charter and Time Warner to demonstrate that the consumer benefits outweigh the potential harms of a combination,” he said.

The Charter/Time Warner deal has already drawn the ire of groups opposed to the Comcast deal.

“Just because this potential merger isn’t as massive as Comcast’s failed takeover of Time Warner Cable does not mean it doesn’t raise similar public interest problems,” wrote S Derek Turner, research director for internet rights lobbying organization Free Press, “nor does it mean the the FCC should not apply the lessons learned in the prior review, to this deal.”

Time Warner and Charter have among the worst customer experience ratings in the US. According to research firm Temkin Group’s 2015 poll the two companies’ TV service ranked joint 278th for customer experience, only Comcast was worse. Time Warner’s internet service ranked 281st.

FCC chairman Tom Wheeler said: “The FCC reviews every merger on its merits and determines whether it would be in the public interest. In applying the public interest test, an absence of harm is not sufficient. The commission will look to see how American consumers would benefit if the deal were to be approved.”

But in the latest cable-giant merger bid, Charter Communications is preparing to dig itself even deeper into debt.

Charter is already swimming in debt, and to merge with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks the company’s committed to taking on as much as $27 billion in new debt. If the merger goes through, the combined company will be saddled with a whopping $66 billion in debt.

This is absurd. Charter is willing to pay a huge premium over the price Comcast offered for Time Warner Cable in its failed merger bid for many of the same assets and customers. For this sum, Charter could build broadband to millions of homes where it currently doesn’t offer service, tripling the size of its existing service area. It could also use that money to cover the company’s current annual capital expenditures 12 times over. Instead, it’ll use that money to line shareholders’ pockets — a completely unnecessary and excessive expense.

How does Charter plan to pay off this debt? With your money.

Free Press research suggests that the merger wouldn’t result in significant savings on programming fees for the new company, nor would Charter benefit significantly from new economies of scale. As we reported in comments filed at the Federal Communications Commission, the only way for Charter to cover its debt burden is to squeeze customers.

The merged company would have enormous market power, controlling more than a quarter of national broadband customers. Together Charter and Comcast would control nearly two-thirds of existing customers, forming a national broadband duopoly of unprecedented scale. The merger would limit consumer choice by giving people even fewer competitive options for cable and broadband service.

And that’s exactly what Charter wants. With monopoly-style market power, it could raise prices on captive customers and protect its existing cable-TV model by thwarting competition from online video services. There’s hardly any competition in the broadband market as it is. Many customers won’t have the option to take their business elsewhere should Charter start hiking rates and abusing its gatekeeper power.

In fact, this substantial market power is the only significant benefit Charter would receive from the merger, and the only realistic way it could pay off its debt. The new company plans to take on an additional debt burden of $1,142 per customer, and Charter has every incentive to make that money back by raising your rates. With U.S. broadband prices already significantly higher than those in most developed countries, this is a significant burden.

This isn’t mere speculation: Charter has told investors it plans to exercise its expanded market power after the merger. How else could it justify taking on such massive debt?

Charter is busy trying to schmooze the FCC with promises of good corporate citizenship, but the numbers don’t lie. If the merger goes through, Charter customers will see considerable price hikes and anti-competitive plans to crush online video.

For many customers, this money grab wouldn’t just be an inconvenience: It would force them offline. It’s likely the merged company would eliminate Time Warner Cable’s popular lower-cost service tiers, forcing current Time Warner Cable customers to pay more for comparable Charter packages — or lose their service. Many of these families already make impossible sacrifices to afford Internet access. This merger will hit them first, and hit them hard.

The merger’s debt tag tells us loud and clear that it’s a bad deal for the public. The math doesn’t work unless Charter starts raising rates and edging out low-income families — all to pay off a handful of greedy cable executives.",

RATINGS RATIONALE

When Charter announced the acquisitions of TWC and BHN in 2015, Moody's stated that the company's CFR would be upgraded following completion of the acquisitions and if debt-to-EBITDA for the combined entity is expected to be sustained below 4.5x (incorporating Moody's standard adjustments). On a pro forma basis, adjusted leverage for the combined company was approximately 4.7x as of 12/31/2015 and based on our expectations for continued steady revenue and EBITDA growth going forward, we estimate that gross adjusted leverage will decline to under 4.5x within the next 12 months. On a consolidated basis, 2015 and Q1-2016 operating performance have tracked very close to Moody's initial forecast, based on which the Charter's ratings were placed on review for upgrade and TWC's debt ratings were placed on review for downgrade, and the final capital structure post-closing is expected to be in line with Moody's assumptions and expectations for the credit ratings at closing.

The incremental scale achieved through the transaction and the large equity consideration in the deal are key drivers of the Ba2 CFR. The Charter component of the combined company will gain significant leverage with respect to the procurement of content and capital equipment, which should yield a meaningful cost savings opportunity. The increased scale will also allow for more robust product capability investments, as development costs will now be spread across a much larger subscriber and revenue base. The company's market position should remain solidly positioned, with a leading broadband infrastructure and growing commercial opportunity. The Ba2 CFR is supported by Charter's number two market position (behind only Comcast Corporation -- A3, Stable) with approximately 17 million video customers, 21 million high speed data customers and 11 million telephony customers. The three companies combined revenue for 2015 was approximately $37 billion and combined EBITDA was roughly $13 billion (Moody's adjusted).

The secured bank debt and secured notes in the combined entity's capital structure (at CCO) are expected to be over 70% of the total debt in the capital structure and therefore only gets one notch up from the CFR to Ba1. As the unsecured notes residing at CCOH, an intermediate holding company, represent only around a quarter of the total debt, they would take a disproportionate share of any loss and therefore are notched down two levels from the CFR to B1. Notably, the secured debt would be notched up to Baa3 if the ratio of secured to unsecured debt changes to 50%. However, we don't anticipate significant changes to the company's capital structure mix to occur over the intermediate term.

The SGL-2 rating reflects our expectation for good liquidity over the next 12-18 months. After completion of the TWC and BHN acquisitions, Charter will have access to a $3 billion revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021. Pro forma for 2015, the combined entity generated free cash flow of approximately $2.4 billion and going forward we expect Charter will generate free cash flows of over $2.5 billion. We expect Charter will generate sufficient free cash flows to fund its operating needs, capex and mandatory term loan amortizations. Further, the company is expected to remain in compliance with its 6.0x consolidated leverage ratio at CCOH and 5.0x consolidated leverage ratio at CCO and 4.0x first lien leverage ratio also at CCO.

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Charter's debt-to-EBITDA (incorporating Moody's standard adjustments) will be sustained below 4.5x over the rating horizon and the company will continue to generate positive free cash flow and maintain good liquidity.

What Could Change the Rating - Down

Moody's would likely downgrade ratings if another sizeable debt funded acquisition, ongoing basic subscriber losses, declining penetration rates, and/or a reversion to more aggressive financial policies contributed to expectations for sustained leverage above 4.5x debt-to-EBITDA or sustained low single digit or worse free cash flow-to-debt.

What Could Change the Rating - Up

Moody's would consider an upgrade with continued improvements in both financial and operating metrics and a commitment to a better credit profile. Specifically, Moody's could upgrade the CFR based on expectations for sustained leverage below 4.0x debt-to-EBITDA and free cash flow-to-debt in excess of 5%, along with maintenance of good liquidity. A higher rating would require clarity on fiscal policy, as well as product penetration levels more in line with industry averages and growth in revenue and EBITDA per homes passed.

One of the largest domestic cable multiple system operators serving approximately 17 million video subscribers (pro forma for TWC and BHN acquisitions), Charter Communications, Inc. maintains its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. Pro forma annual revenue is approximately $37 billion.

The Ba2 CFR is supported by Charter's number two market position (behind only Comcast Corporation -- A3, Stable) with approximately 17 million video customers, 21 million high speed data customers and 11 million telephony customers. The three companies combined revenue for 2015 was approximately $37 billion and combined EBITDA was roughly $13 billion (Moody's adjusted).

The secured bank debt and secured notes in the combined entity's capital structure (at CCO) are expected to be over 70% of the total debt in the capital structure and therefore only gets one notch up from the CFR to Ba1. As the unsecured notes residing at CCOH, an intermediate holding company, represent only around a quarter of the total debt, they would take a disproportionate share of any loss and therefore are notched down two levels from the CFR to B1. Notably, the secured debt would be notched up to Baa3 if the ratio of secured to unsecured debt changes to 50%. However, we don't anticipate significant changes to the company's capital structure mix to occur over the intermediate term.

The SGL-2 rating reflects our expectation for good liquidity over the next 12-18 months. After completion of the TWC and BHN acquisitions, Charter will have access to a $3 billion revolving credit facility maturing in May 2021. Pro forma for 2015, the combined entity generated free cash flow of approximately $2.4 billion and going forward we expect Charter will generate free cash flows of over $2.5 billion. We expect Charter will generate sufficient free cash flows to fund its operating needs, capex and mandatory term loan amortizations. Further, the company is expected to remain in compliance with its 6.0x consolidated leverage ratio at CCOH and 5.0x consolidated leverage ratio at CCO and 4.0x first lien leverage ratio also at CCO.

The stable outlook reflects our expectation that Charter's debt-to-EBITDA (incorporating Moody's standard adjustments) will be sustained below 4.5x over the rating horizon and the company will continue to generate positive free cash flow and maintain good liquidity.

What Could Change the Rating - Down

Moody's would likely downgrade ratings if another sizeable debt funded acquisition, ongoing basic subscriber losses, declining penetration rates, and/or a reversion to more aggressive financial policies contributed to expectations for sustained leverage above 4.5x debt-to-EBITDA or sustained low single digit or worse free cash flow-to-debt.

What Could Change the Rating - Up

Moody's would consider an upgrade with continued improvements in both financial and operating metrics and a commitment to a better credit profile. Specifically, Moody's could upgrade the CFR based on expectations for sustained leverage below 4.0x debt-to-EBITDA and free cash flow-to-debt in excess of 5%, along with maintenance of good liquidity. A higher rating would require clarity on fiscal policy, as well as product penetration levels more in line with industry averages and growth in revenue and EBITDA per homes passed.

One of the largest domestic cable multiple system operators serving approximately 17 million video subscribers (pro forma for TWC and BHN acquisitions), Charter Communications, Inc. maintains its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut. Pro forma annual revenue is approximately $37 billion.

The No. 2 cable operator was caught in a squeeze, at least in its video business. Subscriptions fell as former customers of Time Warner Cable — which Charter acquired last year — saw discounts expire, while the No. 2 cable operator’s programming costs continued to rise.

Charter reported net earnings of $155 million, down 13.4% from last year when you include TWC results, with revenues of $10.16 billion, up 4.3%. Analysts thought the top line would hit $10.25 billion.

Earnings at 57 cents a share also contrast with expectations for 84 cents.

“As we near the first anniversary of the close of our transformative transactions in May of last year, the execution of our integration and operating plan remains on track,” CEO Tom Rutledge says.  “We have now launched our Spectrum pricing and packaging to nearly all of the homes we pass in our new footprint. We are already seeing the benefits of our customer-focused strategy in those markets, including greater connect volumes and the sales of higher quality products, all of which will lead to higher customer satisfaction, lower churn, and faster customer and financial growth in future quarters.”

Charter had 16.74 million video subscribers, down 2% vs last year and down 100,000 vs the previous quarter.


Broadband subscriptions, at 21.8 million, were up 6.7% vs last year — and up 428,000 in the quarter.

Programming expenses rose 8.2% which Charter says reflects “contractual programming increases, renewals and improving expanded basic video sell in at Legacy TWC.”",
"https://www.marketwatch.com/story/merck-makes-deal-buy-schering-plough"," 03/09/09;Marketwatch","News",4,"Merck to buy Schering-Plough for $41.1 billion","Goal of merger is to make Merck less dependent on blockbuster drugs","BOSTON (MarketWatch) -- Merck & Co. and Schering-Plough Corp. said Monday they plan to merge in a deal worth more than $41 billion as part of an effort to create a pharmaceutical giant that is less dependent on U.S. sales or on just a few blockbuster products.

It was the second major drug merger announced this year, as low valuations, coupled with Big Pharma's ongoing quest for diversified revenue streams, are making large-scale takeovers more attractive.

In January, Pfizer and Wyeth WYE, which have both been hit by increased generic competition, announced plans to merge in a deal worth $68 billion. Drug giant Roche is also pushing to buy the 44% of Genentech Inc. DNA, +0.00% that it does not already own. After bumping up its price on the deal last week to $93 a share, giving the deal a value of about $45 billion, Roche reportedly sweetened it further to $95 a share, The Wall Street Journal reported Monday in its online edition.

""That companies like Pfizer and Merck are hunting for acquisitions is not surprising, given the low returns on cash and the lower valuations of target companies because of market conditions,"" Tim Anderson of Sanford Bernstein wrote to clients Monday.
Before the opening bell Monday, the two major drugmakers said they have agreed to a merger that calls for Schering-Plough SGP, +0.00% shareholders to receive $10.50 in cash and 0.5767 in Merck MRK, -0.48% stock for each share of Schering-Plough. Merck's total bid amounts to $23.61 a share. The combined company will be called Merck and headed by Merck Chairman and Chief Executive Richard Clark.

The offer represents a 34% percent premium over the closing price of Schering-Plough shares on March 6. Shares of Merck were down 8% at $20.83 in Monday afternoon, while Schering-Plough shares shot up 15% to $20.32.

Merck is currently the world's eighth largest drugmaker, based on market capitalization, with a value of roughly $48 billion. First is Johnson & Johnson JNJ, +0.09%, with a market cap of around $133 billion, followed by Pfizer. Schering-Plough is 12th.

On a conference call with investors Monday, Merck's Clark said that following the merger, no product would represent more than 10% of sales.

The chief executive also said that the deal would greatly bolster Merck's presence abroad, as around 70% of Schering-Plough's shares are made overseas, including more than $2 billion from emerging markets. The combined company is expected to draw more than 50% of its revenue from outside of the United States.

Merck added it will maintain its annual dividend at its current level of $1.52 a share.

Upon completion, Merck shareholders will own roughly 68% of the combined company and Schering-Plough shareholders the rest.

Job cuts coming
Both companies, which are based in New Jersey, already announced significant job cuts last fall. But the merger is likely to lead to additional reductions. The firms said they can achieve total cost savings of about $3.5 billion through the merger.

On the call, Clark said both companies will institute hiring freezes. He also told Dow Jones Newswires that Merck expects to reduce about 15% of its combined workforce.

Merck and Schering already are partnered on the cholesterol drugs Zetia and Vytorin. But sales of the drugs fell more than 20% in the fourth quarter on lingering concerns that they weren't any more effective than similar cheaper generic drugs on the market.

In addition, Merck's top line has been hammered in recent years by weakened sales for several of its best-selling products due to generic competition and a major recall.

In 2004, the company withdrew its once-hot pain reliever Vioxx from the market over health concerns. The company has since lost patent protection for other top sellers, including the osteoporosis drug Fosamax and hugely popular cholesterol product Zocor.

As a result, Merck is now heavily dependent on sales of its asthma drug Singulair, diabetes pill Januvia and two older blood-pressure products.

Schering-Plough's top line, for its part, has been dominated by the sales of Zetia and Vytorin, along with sales of its rheumatoid-arthritis drug Remicade, which is co-marketed with Johnson & Johnson. In 2007, the company purchased European biotech group Organon BioSciences, which specializes in animal health care, in an effort to diversify.

On the call Monday, analysts questioned whether the proposed merger would affect Schering-Plough's marketing rights to Remicade and an eagerly anticipated follow-on product called golimumab. See full story.

Shares of J&J were down 2% at $46.88 Monday afternoon.

Merck will finance the cash component of the deal with a combination of $9.8 billion of existing cash reserves and $8.5 billion from committed financing to be provided by J.P. Morgan.

Synergies, stronger pipeline
Merck expects the tie-up to result in annual savings of $3.5 billion beyond 2011, in part thanks to the full integration of the companies' existing cholesterol joint venture. Those savings would be in addition to those previously announced by the two companies as part of ongoing restructuring programs.

The deal is expected to boost earnings from the first full year after completion.

""The combined company will benefit from a formidable research and development pipeline, a significantly broader portfolio of medicines and an expanded presence in key international markets, particularly in high-growth emerging markets,"" Clark said in a statement.

He added that Schering-Plough's ""considerable biologics expertise"" would complement Merck's novel proprietary biologics presence to create the best pipeline in the industry. The tie-up will double the number of potential drugs Merck has in Phase III development to 18.

Cantor Fitzgerald's Stephen Pope said that the integration should go relatively smoothly as the deal unites two businesses with a similar mentality. The absorption of a biotech firm, for instance, could have been more difficult because of the difference in culture.

Once the deal is closed the board of the combined company will be made up of the Merck board plus three Schering-Plough representatives.

Fred Hassan, the chief executive of Schering-Plough, intends to participate in the integration until the close, according to the companies.",

(NYSE: MRK) today outlined its global plans following the completion of Merck's merger with Schering-Plough Corporation announced yesterday. The new Merck is a global health care leader aimed at providing innovative, distinctive products and services that save and improve lives, while satisfying customer needs and creating long term shareholder value.

""""With our merger now complete, we are ready to deliver on the promise of a new Merck built on a foundation of scientific innovation and dedication to the well-being of patients around the world,"""" said Richard T. Clark, chairman, president and chief executive officer of Merck. """"On 'Day One' for the new Merck, we are stronger and better equipped to make a difference in the lives of people globally through our broadened, diversified portfolio of innovative medicines and vaccines, and products for consumer and animal health.

""""Our integration teams prepared us well for a strong start today, with thorough plans designed to ensure a seamless transition for our customers and employees,"""" added Mr. Clark. """"The combination of the considerable talents of Schering-Plough and Merck employees across the globe positions Merck to move through this dynamic time for our industry with a clear vision for the future.""""

From the outset, Merck is a global health care leader with a diversified portfolio of prescription medicines, vaccines and animal and consumer health products. This portfolio is complemented by a robust pipeline with more than 15 promising late-stage candidates spanning critical therapeutic categories. Merck now has approximately 106,000 employees and operates in more than 140 countries around the world, including emerging markets. The company expects to generate more than 50 percent of its revenue outside the United States.

""""The people of the new Merck share a passion for the good our medicines and vaccines can do for patients and a commitment to pursuing high-quality results with our customers and partners,"""" Mr. Clark said. """"Thanks to the talent and dedication of scientists at both companies, the combined company offers an outstanding clinical development pipeline that will greatly increase our ability to deliver important new medicines to patients.""""

The company's corporate headquarters will be in Whitehouse Station, NJ, as previously indicated. In addition, the company's U.S. organization for the Global Human Health division and Merck Research Laboratories will be headquartered in Upper Gwynedd, PA. The former Schering-Plough headquarters in Kenilworth, NJ and Merck's operations in Rahway, NJ, will continue to be important sites, with large and diverse operations encompassing marketing, manufacturing and research. At this time, all other sites will continue to operate as they did before the merger.

Key Therapeutic Areas

The new Merck has a broad portfolio of medicines - an engine for consistent, sustainable growth - driven in part by the addition of valuable products with long periods of exclusivity. By leveraging Merck's expanded product offerings, the company expects to benefit from additional revenue growth opportunities. For example, Merck will pursue expanded life-cycle management through the introduction of potential new combinations and formulations of existing products.

The company's diverse portfolio of adult, adolescent and pediatric vaccines and medicines spans important therapeutic areas, including cardiovascular, diabetes, obesity, bone, respiratory, immunology, dermatology, infectious disease, oncology, neurosciences, ophthalmology, women's health and endocrinology.

Diversified Businesses

The new Merck's expanded portfolio also includes leading products from its Animal Health and Consumer Health Care business units.

Merck's Animal Health business is a world leader with market-leading products for a broad range of species and strong growth potential. The division has more than 1,000 marketed products and generates approximately $3 billion in revenues.

The company's Consumer Health Care business has a number of attractive brands such as CLARITIN, COPPERTONE, DR. SCHOLL'S and MIRALAX.

Financial Highlights

Merck is targeting a high single digit non-GAAP EPS¹ compound annual growth rate from 2009 to 2013 (with the 2009 base representing Merck's previous stand-alone non-GAAP EPS guidance of $3.20 - $3.30). Additionally, in 2013, Merck is targeting free cash flow to be approximately $15 billion. The combined company will have a strong balance sheet with cash and investments of approximately $8 billion at the time of the closing. As previously indicated, Merck expects the transaction to be modestly accretive in 2010.

Merck also continues to expect to achieve substantial incremental cost savings of approximately $3.5 billion annually beyond 2011 which are expected to come from all areas across the combined company.

The strong cash flow and substantial cost savings will enable the company to continue to invest in some of the best investment opportunities, including pipeline candidates with the greatest probability of success, as well as licensing opportunities. By optimizing its investments, the new Merck will maximize the benefits of strategic growth initiatives and R&D efforts to solidify its position at the forefront of innovation and enhance its scientific and technological leadership.

Additionally, Merck's Board of Directors continues to be committed to maintaining the dividend at the current level.

Organizational Structure

During the past six months, Merck and Schering-Plough merger integration teams worked hard to successfully maintain the business momentum of the two companies while ensuring operational readiness and business continuity for the merged company.

The integration plans are focused on these priorities: an effective transition for customers and employees; putting the right people in the right jobs; realizing projected merger synergies in the form of cost savings and revenue growth opportunities; and maintaining momentum in the company's late stage pipeline.

The company took significant steps prior to the merger's completion to advance its integration planning objectives. In August, Merck announced the new organizational structure and top leadership team for the combined company. Last month, approximately 300 executives from Merck and Schering-Plough were named to key country leadership positions to ensure that all markets around the world would be ready for business on the first day of operations for the new Merck.

The company's previously announced organizational structure takes advantage of the combined strengths of Merck and Schering-Plough to create a more customer-focused, innovative, and diversified global health care company positioned to capitalize on the company's greatest opportunities for growth, particularly in emerging markets, biologics and vaccines. Merck has five primary divisions: Global Human Health, Animal Health, Consumer Health Care, Merck Research Laboratories and Merck Manufacturing.

Leadership

The new Merck will benefit from the unparalleled industry experience of senior leaders from both Schering-Plough and Merck, with approximately 40 percent of Schering-Plough's senior leaders joining the combined company.

As announced in August, the Executive Committee, reporting directly to CEO Dick Clark, includes the following individuals, as well as a Chief Medical Officer who will be named at a later date: Stanley F. Barshay, EVP and president, Consumer Health Care; Richard S. Bowles, Ph.D., chief compliance officer; Willie A. Deese, EVP and president, Merck Manufacturing; Kenneth C. Frazier, EVP and president, Global Human Health; Mirian Graddick-Weir, Ph.D., EVP, Human Resources; Peter N. Kellogg, chief financial officer; Peter S. Kim, Ph.D., EVP and president, Merck Research Laboratories; Raul E. Kohan, president, Animal Health; Bruce N. Kuhlik, general counsel; J. Chris Scalet, chief information officer, Global Services; and Mervyn Turner, Ph.D, chief strategy officer.

Corporate Branding

With the merger complete, Merck will take a global approach to unify and simplify use of its trade name. The company will use the trade name 'Merck' in the United States and Canada and elsewhere use the trade name 'MSD.'

About Merck

MICHELE NORRIS, Host:

From NPR News, this is ALL THINGS CONSIDERED. I'm Michele Norris.

ROBERT SIEGEL, Host:

And I'm Robert Siegel. With the credit markets in such bad shape, the number of big corporate mergers has slowed to a trickle, but not in the pharmaceutical business. Today, Merck and Schering-Plough said they were joining forces. The deal is valued at more than $41 billion. Meanwhile, there were reports that Genentech and Roche are close to a deal of their own. NPR's Jim Zarolli looks at why the drug business is changing so fast.

JIM ZAROLLI: Back in the days when stock prices were high and companies could get all the capital they needed, every Monday seemed to bring news of another big merger. So the announcement today that Merck is buying Schering-Plough brought a feeling of deja-vu to Wall Street. Here is Merck chairman Richard T. Clark, who will lead the new company.

RICHARD CLARK: This will be a powerhouse in the health care industry as we move forward on a global basis. There is no better combination than Merck and Schering-Plough.

ZAROLLI: This is the second big drug merger in six weeks; the other was Pfizer's acquisition of Wyeth. What's driving this is a combination of factors. Veran Mehta(ph), who runs an investment advisory company, says the pharmaceutical business is in a lot of trouble; the patents on a lot of important drugs are expiring. Mehta says researching into new drugs isn't going as well as the companies had hoped.

VERAN MEHTA: All of these are converging to create some pretty unusual times for the pharma industry managements that are not used to such challenges, and they're trying to buy some more breathing room here.

ZAROLLI: Mehta says Merck has had its own set of problems. It teamed up with Schering-Plough to sell the cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia, but the drugs have been less effective at fighting heart disease then originally thought.

MEHTA: So what was supposed to become a $10 billion franchise has stalled at $4 billion, and that was one of the crown jewels in their portfolio.

ZAROLLI: Both Merck and Schering-Plough had to lay off employees last fall. Now by merging outright they're hoping to be able to cut expenses even further and survive the economic storm. Merck said today that the merger would save it $3.5 billion out of annual revenue of about 47 billion. Merck is also getting something else. Schering-Plough has a strong presence overseas and some promising drugs in its pipeline. Steve Brozak heads WBB Securities, a broker dealer firm that specializes in health care.

STEVE BROZAK: They're obviously getting a significant portfolio of revenue items today, and they are getting some later stage products for tomorrow.

ZAROLLI: But Brozak notes that the merger could be bad in one important sense. In recent years Merck has partnered with a lot of biotechnology companies. Brozak says these are where a lot of the most important new drugs will be discovered. And with the credit markets hurting, a lot of these biotech companies are struggling.

BROZAK: Probably the majority of public and private biotech companies don't have enough cash to get through the end of the year. So their needs are immediate.

ZAROLLI: When big companies merge, Brozak says, they have less money to put into these kinds of partnerships. And that will make the plight of the biotech companies more dire. But pharmaceutical giants like Merck and Pfizer are mired in troubles of their own right now. And merging is one way for them to survive and keep their shareholders happy until their fortunes change.",

Merck & Co. (Whitehouse Station NJ), the drugmaker buying rival Schering-Plough Corp. (Kenilworth NJ), said profit in the first quarter fell 57% on declining sales for its cervical cancer vaccine and drugs for cholesterol and bone loss. Merck (NYSE:MRK) is seeking to reverse the trend by paying about $44 billion to buy Schering-Plough, which reported that its first-quarter profit more than doubled and earnings excluding some items beat analysts' estimates. Merck's sales dropped 7.5%, and the drugmaker said it won't seek U.S. regulatory approval for its migraine drug this year after a study showed possible side effects. Merck has been firing workers, closing plants and reorganizing how it finds and sells medicines to lower costs, as drugs with about $10 billion in annual sales face generic competition by 2013. ""Given the poor-quality first quarter, as well as the major pipeline setback, we expect Merck shares to be weak,"" said Seamus Fernandez, an analyst at Leerink Swann & Co. in Boston. The acquisition of Schering-Plough is expected to close in the fourth quarter, Merck has said.
Merck's net income sank to $1.46 billion, or 67 cents a share, after gains a year earlier on one-time payments from Iroko Pharmaceuticals LLC (Philadelphia PA) and London-based AstraZeneca Plc. Excluding some items, Merck missed analysts' profit estimates by 4 cents a share, and the drugmaker cut its 2009 revenue forecast by $500 million to a range of $23.2 billion to $23.7 billion. Quarterly revenue declined to $5.39 billion from $5.82 billion as the recession caused patients, governments and insurers to cut spending, Merck Chief Executive Officer Richard T. Clark said. Merck closed the week down $2.28, or 9%, at $23.45.
Schering-Plough said earnings rose to $805 million, or 46 cents a share, from $314 million, or 17 cents, a year earlier, when the drugmaker had a charge from purchasing Organon BioSciences BV. Earnings per share excluding one-time items were 56 cents, topping the 47 cents average estimate of analysts. Revenue from the anti-inflammatory drug Remicade increased 2.2% to $518 million. That compares with the $495 million estimate of Barbara Ryan, an analyst at Deutsche Bank based in Greenwich, Connecticut. Schering-Plough shares Remicade revenue with Johnson & Johnson (New Brunswick NJ). The company's revenue fell 5.7% to $4.39 billion, missing analysts' estimates, as the rising value of the dollar against world currencies reduced sales 10 percentage points, Schering-Plough said. Company shares closed the week down $1.17, or 5%, to $22.17.

* * *
Lilly's Net Income Rises on New ImClone Revenue. Eli Lilly & Co. (Indianapolis IN) said profit rose 23% after the drugmaker added sales of the Erbitux cancer drug from its purchase of ImClone Systems Inc. (New York) in November. First-quarter net income increased to $1.31 billion, or $1.20 a share, from $1.06 billion, or 97 cents, a year earlier. Earnings excluding acquisition costs and other one-time items were $1.20 a share, beating the 99 cents average estimate of analysts. Lilly bought ImClone on Nov. 25, adding the cancer medicine Erbitux and experimental drugs to bolster revenue before the 2011 patent expiration of the antipsychotic medicine Zyprexa, the company's top product with $4.7 billion in sales last year. Lilly won European approval to sell its new blood thinner prasugrel in February and a U.S. review is ongoing. ""Although a higher likelihood of approval for prasugrel does improve Lilly's earnings visibility, uncertainties on several other fronts still persist,"" said Roopesh Patel, an analyst with UBS Investment Research in New York. ""Lilly will encounter meaningful generic pressure between 2010 to 2015 when roughly half its projected 2010 sales are expected to erode due to patent expirations.""
Lilly affirmed its 2009 profit forecast of $4 to $4.25 a share. Excluding one-time items, analysts had estimated $4.14 a share. Quarterly revenue increased 5% to $5.05 billion. Worldwide, 3% of that growth was due to price increases. Foreign exchange rates diminished growth by 6%, Lilly said. Zyprexa faced fresh competition this year after lower-priced generic copies of Johnson & Johnson's (New Brunswick NJ) Risperdal, a rival schizophrenia treatment, went on sale in July. Zyprexa sales were little changed at $1.12 billion. Lilly shares closed the week off 74 cents, or 2%, at $33.01. The shares declined 35% in the 12 months before last week.",

As Krensavage recalls, the executive scoffed, ""Why would we want to buy Schering-Plough?""



Separately, Krensavage posed a similar question to Fred Hassan, then Schering's CEO, this time during an analyst meeting. ""Hassan had no direct reply,"" Krensavage recalls, but ""his body language suggested a conflict between Merck and Schering-Plough."" (Krensavage speculates that it was owing to differences over pricing strategy for the cholesterol drugs.)

Apparently, Hassan and his counterpart at Merck, Richard Clark, found some mutual attraction after all. In March 2009, Merck announced that it was acquiring Schering-Plough for $41.1 billion in cash and stock.

Krensavage, who now runs an eponymous hedge fund firm in New York specializing in pharmaceuticals, and other longtime merger advocates are scratching their heads trying to understand why Merck finally changed its mind and why Schering, with a stronger product line, agreed to the deal.

But maybe Merck was right to wait. There are significant signs that this marriage - which creates the second-largest drug company in the world, by most rankings, with some $42 billion in annual sales - may just buck the odds and lead to a happy ending.

""They're keenly aware of how many of these mergers have failed in the past, and they're very determined to show this as a counterexample,"" says Kris Jenner, manager of T. Rowe Price's $2 billion Health Sciences Fund. Before the announcement of the merger, which closed in November, Jenner's fund owned about $40 million each of Merck and Schering-Plough, its second- and third-biggest pharmaceuticals holdings.

For more than a decade - buffeted by faltering research, expiring patents, competition from biotech firms, public pressure over prices, tougher government scrutiny and the looming uncertainty of health care reform - most drug companies have seen their salvation in mergers. Sanofi-Synth&labo bought Aventis. GlaxoWellcome teamed up with SmithKline Beecham. Sandoz and Ciba-Geigy became Novartis. Pharmacia & Upjohn joined with Monsanto. Pfizer gobbled up everything in sight. Although the combinations have usually cut costs, their success in bringing new drugs to market has typically been spotty.

The management of Merck, meanwhile, refused to join the game. Other than small acquisitions, the company hadn't done a major deal since the Eisenhower presidency. That might be seen as a principled belief in independence, except that independence wasn't working.

Merck's stock price languished for much of the past decade, tumbling from a high of about $90 at the start of 2001 to the low 20s by early last year. The company's annual revenue was stuck between $22&billion and $24&billion from 2003 through 2008, as two of Merck's biggest sellers lost their patent protection, opening the door to cheaper, generic competition. Of the products that were expected to replace them, about a dozen didn't sell as well as predicted, had safety issues or never made it to market. Even a groundbreaking vaccine for cervical cancer couldn't jump-start the bottom line. Moreover, Merck's product line was seen as too narrow, relying heavily on vaccines and cardiovascular treatments. Under Raymond Gilmartin, the chief executive from 1994 to 2005, morale slumped and key executives fled.

The worst blow was the collapse of painkiller Vioxx, which at its peak brought in $2.5 billion a year. In September 2004, after a three-year study showed that taking Vioxx for more than 18 months doubled a patient's risk of stroke and heart attacks, Merck pulled it from the market, prompting thousands of lawsuits against the drugmaker, which had been pitching Vioxx in hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of television and print ads.

That arguably turned Merck - dubbed the ""most admired"" company in America by Fortune magazine every year from 1987 through 1993 - into the least-admired drug company, as Vioxx became the poster child for the entire industry's hypermarketing and insufficient testing of potentially dangerous drugs.

It also spelled the end for Gilmartin. Seven months after Merck pulled Vioxx, he was pushed out and replaced by Clark, then the head of manufacturing. A three-decade Merck lifer, Clark was largely dismissed as a nicer but no stronger CEO. Morale improved, but the company's disdain for mergers didn't change.

So why did Clark and other top Merck executives suddenly decide to entertain the idea that analysts and investors had been tossing around for years? And why does that bet look good now?

A turning point was Schering's $14.4 billion 2007 acquisition of Netherlands-based Organon BioSciences, a biotech company with successful products for hepatitis C, infertility and contraception. ""What we started to see in the Schering-Plough organization became very, very attractive,"" Peter Kellogg, Merck's CFO, tells Institutional Investor.

Merck and Schering also have the benefit of familiarity. The two companies have jointly marketed cholesterol drugs Vytorin and Zetia since 2004. ""That experience together built a lot of confidence,"" notes Kellogg.

During the merger process, Merck seems to have been especially sensitive to the morale and ego problems that can arise in melding staffs and laboratories. ""We are spending a great deal of time on culture, because we truly believe that you need to get the culture right in the new company in order to make sure that your strategy and your objectives are executed the right way,"" Clark, who declined to be interviewed for this story, told investors at a JPMorgan health care conference in January.

Timing, too, may help the merger succeed. ""Acquisitions done when markets are down tend to do much better than acquisitions done when markets are up,"" points out Peter Tollman, a senior partner at the Boston Consulting Group. ""Often they're more strategic, and you get better pricing.""

Most important, Schering brought a rich dowry of drugs in development, including products for blood clots and skin cancer and a new anesthetic. With Organon, Schering gained blockbuster therapeutic protein PegIntron for hepatitis C, as well as another promising treatment for the same disease. In addition, some of Schering's biggest sellers have many years remaining on their patents - most notably, Saphris for schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, just approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Schering also co-markets rheumatoid arthritis blockbuster Remicade and a new successor, Simponi (although the merger with Merck may jeopardize those rights).To top off this treasure trove, Schering adds geographic diversification, because it has a much stronger presence than Merck overseas: According to Kellogg, Merck got 44 percent of its sales premerger from outside the U.S., but that rises to 53 percent in the new combined Merck - putting it more in line with other global pharmaceuticals companies, which typically get about 55 percent of their revenue from non-U.S. markets.

""Merck's decision to purchase Schering-Plough is an absolute about-face,"" says Krensavage, who wouldn't disclose his hedge fund's total assets but says its Merck holdings are significant. ""The answer comes down to research.""

In the past, Merck and other members of Big Pharma would have had replacements ready to roll out of the labs as their old drugs reached the end of their patents. But in the pharmaceuticals world, it has become almost clich& to note that research and development has slowed. Traditionally, drugs are developed by screening hundreds of thousands of chemical combinations until one finally hits a particular disease target. Not surprisingly, the easy matches have long since been discovered. The mapping of the human genome at the start of the new millennium was supposed to move research smoothly along to the next stage, leading to the creation of biologically based ""designer"" drugs aimed at specific genes. However, that's turned out to be a slower, more complex process than expected - and in any case, it's a field that's been dominated by biotechs, not Big Pharma. Moreover, when companies finally do find drugs that seem to work, they face recently tightened FDA standards for approval.

As a result of both weaker R&D and tougher FDA oversight, regulators approved only 26 new molecular entities - that is, unique new drugs - last year, versus 34 in 1999.

Fewer new approvals inevitably depress sales. In October, IMS Health, a Norwalk, Connecticut-based pharmaceuticals industry forecasting firm, predicted that worldwide drug sales would grow at what it called ""historically low levels"" through 2013 - a 4 to 7 percent compounded annual rate - although it did cite ""stronger-than-expected demand in the U.S."" By contrast, IMS Health reported sales growth averaging 11.8 percent annually from 1999 to 2003.

With fewer products to sell, virtually every big drug company has slashed costs. The industry has shed more than 100,000 jobs since 2004 - including nearly 18,000 at Merck, which shrank its premerged workforce to 52,700.

As if that weren't enough pressure, now the industry will have to figure out what health care reform might mean. Big Pharma recognized early on the potential benefit of gaining 30 million new customers in the U.S.; its trade organization last June reached an agreement with the White House to support the basic concept of reform in return for a pledge to limit any hit to the industry - mainly via rebates and discounts in government programs - to $80 billion over ten years. Through the ups and downs of the reform debate, even as the House of Representatives raised the potential hit to $140 billion, the drug companies stayed loyal to their deal. In late January, however, the road to health care reform took a new twist, when Massachusetts elected Republican Scott Brown to fill the senatorial seat formerly held by Ted Kennedy, breaking the Democrats' supermajority in the Senate. Regardless of what any final legislation looks like, the newly merged Merck - thanks largely to its Schering dowry - is better positioned than many other drugmakers to profit in a post-health-care-reform world.


The postmerger optimism at Merck is a stark contrast to the negative sentiment swirling around the company just a few years ago. In fact, in many ways, Merck has faced a tougher climb out of trouble than its competitors. That's partly because it started from such a high plane and fell so far.

During its ""most admired"" years of groundbreaking research, Merck was led by a brilliant, charismatic and arrogant scientist named P. Roy Vagelos. The son of Greek immigrants, Vagelos grew up in the shadow of Merck's great laboratories in Rahway, New Jersey, and then headed those labs for nine years. Famously, he used to waylay scientists in the hallways to discuss their projects and would eat lunch with staff in the company cafeteria.

Two changes in the early 1990s eroded that culture: Vagelos was forced to retire at 65, under company rules, and the top brass moved to new corporate offices in Whitehouse Station, about 20 miles west of Rahway. Gilmartin - who had run medical device maker Becton, Dickinson and Co. before joining Merck in June 1994 as CEO - was viewed as a nice guy yet was widely disliked by employees. Critics say he relied too much on consultants and squelched research creativity by adding layers of bureaucracy, and Wall Street stopped trusting his optimistic pronouncements. What hurt Gilmartin most was that he was an outsider. As many employees and other critics saw it, he didn't understand Merck or the pharma industry.

Adding to the company's woes, Vagelos, in his most ill-conceived decision, had paid $6.6 billion in 1993 for pharmacy benefits manager Medco Containment Services - a middleman that administers corporate prescription drug benefits - as a defensive move against the Clinton-era prospect of health care reform. But Medco's penny-pinching ways never fit in with Merck's pour-on-the-R&D-dollars culture and dragged down profit margins. Gilmartin - in one of his most heralded moves - spun off Medco in 2002.

Then the patents on the Vagelos-era blockbusters began to expire. In 2006, Merck's previously biggest-selling drug, Zocor, went off patent. Sales of the cholesterol-lowering drug, which at one point amounted to more than $5 billion annually, plummeted to $877 million in 2007. The patent on Fosamax expired in 2008. The osteoporosis drug, which averaged $3.1 billion a year in sales from 2005 through 2007, generated just $1.1 billion in revenue for 2009, according to estimates from Mehta Partners, a New York-based research boutique.

Nor is the patent expiration issue going away. Hypertension medications Cozaar and Hyzaar go off patent this year, putting more than $3.5 billion in sales at risk, and the $4.6 billion asthma and allergy drug Singulair will follow in 2012 (see table, page 60). With a host of smaller drugs set to tumble next, Vishal Manchanda, a senior global pharmaceuticals analyst at Mehta Partners, predicts that Merck will lose 25 percent of its premerger revenue by 2014.

The intended replacements - one of which was to be Vioxx - have not lived up to expectations. Zetia and Vytorin were supposed to extend Merck's dominance of the cholesterol drug franchise by adding a new method of fighting ""bad"" low-density lipoproteins. However, in a four-year trial of some 720 patients, the drugs didn't slow, and possibly speeded up, the growth of fatty plaques in arteries, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes.

In 2006, Merck introduced Gardasil, a vaccine for the most common types of the virus that causes cervical cancer, to glowing headlines. Although it was the first vaccine proven to prevent cancer, the drug always flirted with controversy because the cervical cancer virus is spread mainly through sexual contact and Merck is marketing the vaccine to the parents of teenage and preteen girls. The company has negotiated that minefield carefully with religious-right groups, but it has aroused the ire of consumer advocates with heavy-handed lobbying.

When Clark took over as CEO, he worked hard to shore up morale, meeting regularly with managers and sales representatives around the U.S., giving staff his e-mail address and reviving Vagelos's vaunted cafeteria chats. In the ultimate symbolic gesture, he invited Vagelos for a talk - something Gilmartin had refused to do - and, yes, the two ate lunch in the cafeteria. Industry watchers say Clark overall has been a pleasant surprise and a stronger chief than expected.

Clark also set out to improve drug development by bringing together the researchers, marketers and manufacturing people who had been kept in separate fiefdoms. Merck has historically attracted brilliant scientists to head its R&D - Vagelos, then Edward Scolnick and now Peter Kim, lured from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2001. Although Kim, a research biologist, had little administrative experience, he learned quickly on the job. Most notably, he opened up the labs' doors, encouraging researchers to look for new compounds in outside scientific literature and to use their contacts to seek acquisitions.

Yet all the effort and brilliance haven't produced big results. In the past year and a half, Merck has halted mid- and late-stage research on what seemed like promising treatments for heart failure, migraines and obesity and has delayed filing an application for a more advanced migraine product, all because of serious side effects seen in human trials. In addition, in April 2008 the FDA rejected a combination of allergy drugs Claritin and Singulair that, ironically, would have been developed in a joint venture with Schering. Days later - to the shock of virtually the entire industry - regulators nixed what was supposed to be a shoo-in, a cholesterol-&fighting drug that melded the well-known vitamin niacin with a compound to prevent the common side effect of flushing. And last fall, in an extraordinary move, the FDA wouldn't accept an application to combine Zetia with another cholesterol pill, Pfizer's Lipitor, demanding to see more data first.

Of course, Merck isn't the only company that has had to deal with a tougher FDA. ""The FDA has asked in some cases for more data than perhaps they had asked for in the past,"" Kellogg says.

Merck has enjoyed good news on the legal front. In November 2007 the company settled the vast majority of the roughly 50,000 Vioxx claims for the relatively low sum of $4.85 billion. Analysts credit Kenneth Frazier, then Merck's general counsel, who insisted on fighting every case rather than settling early. He has since been promoted to head of global human health, the No. 2 job at the company, overseeing the drug business that accounts for almost all of Merck's revenue.

For a while, Merck faced the risk of hundreds more potential suits claiming that osteoporosis drug Fosamax destroys jawbone tissue. But investors relaxed when the first case ended in a mistrial last year. ""I do not believe there are enough plaintiffs to make it a significant threat,"" contends Ira Loss, a senior health care analyst at investment research firm Washington Analysis.",

(Reuters) - Avago Technologies Ltd (AVGO.O) agreed on Thursday to buy Broadcom Corp BRCM.O for $37 billion in the largest merger of chipmakers ever, turning a lesser known company run by a ferocious dealmaker into one of the biggest industry players.

Avago, which serves the wireless and industrial markets, is offering Broadcom shareholders $17 billion in cash and Avago shares valued at $20 billion.

Broadcom is best known for its connectivity chips, which are used widely in smartphones made by Apple Inc (AAPL.O) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (005930.KS).

The deal is the biggest so far by Avago Chief Executive Hock Tan, who has developed a small chipmaker into a $36 billion company through acquisitions since taking the helm nine years ago.

Tan, a serial deal-maker, has trimmed Avago’s portfolio by divesting units while bulking up in faster-growing areas.

The combined company, to be based in Singapore and known as Broadcom, will be the third-largest U.S. semiconductor maker by revenue, behind Intel Corp (INTC.O) and Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O). The merger is the industry’s second megadeal this year and is unlikely to be the last, analysts said.

The $37 billion price represents a premium of about 28 percent over Broadcom’s market value of $28.85 billion as of Tuesday’s close, before the Wall Street Journal reported that the companies were in talks.

MORE DEALS?
Demand for cheaper chips and new products to power Internet-connected gadgets is driving consolidation in the industry.

The Avago-Broadcom deal follows NXP Semiconductors’ (NXPI.O) $11.8 billion offer to buy Freescale Semiconductor Ltd FSL.N in March. Avago had also bid for Freescale, people familiar with the matter said at the time.

Intel has also been in talks to buy chipmaker Altera Corp (ALTR.O) in a deal that could top $10 billion.

Until Thursday, Avago’s biggest deal was for chipmaker LSI Corp, which it bought for $6.6 billion last year.

Tan’s strategy has been to look at potential targets that do not necessarily have the best strategic fit but have cost-cutting potential to build value.

Avago and Broadcom first spoke about a potential merger in October 2014 but could not agree on a price, said people familiar with the matter who are unauthorized to speak publicly about it.

Talks heated up in April when Avago approached Broadcom again with higher offers, and negotiations continued until the two agreed on a deal.

Private equity firm Silver Lake Partners, which is an Avago investor and holds a board seat, worked closely with the company to help evaluate Broadcom and structure the deal, said two sources who are unauthorized to speak publicly about the deal.

BARGAINING CHIP
The merger will help the companies improve their bargaining position with manufacturers.

Irvine, California-based Broadcom has been struggling to grow as competition in the mobile chip business intensifies. The company’s revenue increased by just 1.5 percent last year.

Broadcom’s shares closed down 1.5 percent at $56.25 on Thursday, while Avago’s fell 0.62 percent to $142.38.

The companies said they expected to close the deal by the end of the first quarter of 2016 and save $750 million within 18 months. The deal has a breakup fee of $1 billion, one of the unidentified sources said.

The new Broadcom would have annual revenue of $15 billion and an enterprise value of $77 billion, the companies said in a statement.

Broadcom shareholders will own about 32 percent of the combined company. They would also have the option to choose between various combinations of cash and stock.


Avago, which is incorporated in Singapore and also has headquarters in San Jose, California, said it intended to fund the cash portion of the deal by using funds from the combined company and new debt of $9 billion.

Avago was advised by Deutsche Bank, Bank of America, Barclays, Citigroup and Credit Suisse.

Broadcom was advised by JPMorgan Chase (JPM.N), while Evercore served as financial adviser to the Special Committee of the board.

Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP is the legal adviser to Broadcom. Broadcom co-founder Henry Nicholas was advised by Centerview and Morrison & Forester.",

The deal, one of the largest tech acquisitions in history, values the combined companies at $77 billion in enterprise value.

Avago and Broadcom predicted the combined firm would have ""the most diversified communications platform in the semiconductor industry, with combined annual revenues of approximately $15 billion.""

This deal could mark the start of a new string of megamergers in the tech industry, says Christopher Rolland, an analyst with investment bank firm FBR & Co. ""We have seen a slowdown in top buying growth rates. So one of your options to at least generate growth on the bottom line is to do accretive deals,"" he said. ""There is actually very little strategic overlap between the two companies. What they will get out of it is size.""

WARNING SIGN? Tech deals on pace to surpass 1999

The deal terms call for Singapore-headquartered Avago to pay $17 billion in cash and the economic equivalent of 140 million of the company's shares, valued at $20 billion as of Wednesday, to acquire California-based Broadcom.

As a result, Broadcom shareholders are projected to own 32% of the combined company. For each of their current Broadcom shares, they will have the option to receive either $54.50 in cash, 0.4378 ordinary shares in a newly formed Singapore holding company, a restricted security equivalent to 0.4378 shares of the holding company or a combination of the three options.

Avago said it plans to fund the deal with a combination of cash on hand and $9 billion in new debt.

Avago shares closed up less than 1% at $142.38 Thursday. Broadcom shares closed down 1.58% at $56.25. However, the company's stock had rocketed Wednesday, closing up 21.45% at $57.15, amid heavy trading sparked by market rumors and a report by The Wall Street Journal that the acquisition was imminent.

Hock Tan, president and CEO of Avago, will keep both those roles in the combined company, which will be known as Broadcom Limited. Henry Samueli, Broadcom's co-founder, board chairman and chief technology officer, will join the board of the new company and serve as its chief technology officer.

Henry Nicholas, a Broadcom co-founder and past CEO, will serve in a strategic advisory role in the combined company, and will report to Tan.

""Today's announcement marks the combination of the unparalleled engineering prowess of Broadcom with Avago's heritage of technology from HP, AT&T, and LSI Logic in a landmark transaction for the semiconductor industry,"" Tan said in a statement issued with the deal announcement. ""Together with Broadcom, we intend to bring the combined company to a level of profitability consistent with Avago's long-term target model.""

Scott McGregor, Broadcom's president and CEO, predicted the transaction would benefit all of the company's key stakeholders.

""Our customers will gain access to a greater breadth of technology and product capability,"" McGregor said in a statement issued by the companies. ""For our shareholders, the transaction provides both compelling up-front value as well as the opportunity to participate in the future upside of the combined business.""

The planned acquisition is expected to help the combined company cut cost as it battles competition to supply vital products for the tech market. The companies predicted the deal would generate $750 million of projected annual cost synergies within 18 months.

Since the companies have different product lines, they will achieve limited R&D savings, Rolland says. Among Broadcom's strengths are its WiFi chips for smartphones – Apple and Samsung are buyers. Avago's FBAR frequency filters are found in Apple and Samsung devices, too.

For the two companies, ""there's no product overlap so they won't lose any sales in areas where they are operating,"" Rolland said. And they could cement customer relationships with ""some price bundling"" of complimentary products, he said.

The combination of Broadcom, listed ninth in an Electronics Weekly 2014 ranking of the world's largest semiconductor firms, and Avago, ranked 17th, is expected to make the proposed combination the industry's sixth-largest chipmaker.

The companies said both of their boards of directors had unanimously approved the transaction. The deal is expected to close by the end of next year's first quarter, subject to regulatory approval, as well as approval by Avago and Broadcom stockholders, the firms said.

Expect more tech industry deals, Rolland says. Intel (INTC) could still acquire Altera (ALTR) and Texas Instruments (TXN) might be surveying smaller chip makers such as Microchip Technology (MCHP), Analog Devices (ADI), Atmel (ATML) and Maxim (MXIM).

""Money is still cheap,"" he said. ""So those dynamics are sort of coming together to cause this consolidation.""",

Ltd., including the 'BB+' long-term Issuer Default Rating (IDR). The affirmation follows the announcement that Avago Technologies Ltd. (Avago) will acquire Broadcom Corp. (Broadcom) for $37 billion.

Pro forma for the expected debt issuance, Fitch's actions affect approximately $16 billion of total debt, including the undrawn $500 million secured revolving credit facility (RCF). The Rating Outlook is Stable. A list of current ratings follows at the end of this release.

Fitch believes the Broadcom acquisition will modestly strengthen Avago's operating profile with increased scale and diversification, despite operating profit margin dilution and integration risk associated with the deal.

Fitch believes the combined company will benefit from greater scale, given escalating investment intensity required to maintain technology leadership. Annual revenues more than double to $15.1 billion, versus Fitch's prior expectations for $6.6 billion of fiscal 2015 sales for Avago on a standalone basis. Combined annual free cash flow (FCF) should exceed $1 billion, supporting roughly $3 billion of research and development (R&D) and $1 billion of capital spending through the cycle.

The acquisition also diversifies revenues, reducing Avago's exposure to short-cycle products, including smart phones, which Fitch estimates currently represent 35% to 40% of total sales. The combination adds Broadcom's market leadership in infrastructure and networking and broadband and connectivity. Pro forma for the combination, the Wired Infrastructure segment should represent roughly 40% of total revenues, Wireless closer to 35%, Enterprise Storage roughly 10% and the remainder from Industrial & Other, which includes licensing.

Fitch expects operating EBITDA margin in the low 30s, pro forma for the transaction, down from the high 30s on a standalone basis. Fitch anticipates less volatile gross margins from increased diversification, although profitability will remain cyclical due to substantial fixed costs in the operating model. Over the intermediate term, Fitch expects $750 million of anticipated cost synergies the company expects to achieve within 18 months following the acquisition's close to drive mid-cycle operating EBITDA margin expansion.

Fitch believes there is meaningful integration risk associated with the transaction, given the deal is the largest ever in the semiconductor space",

Strong iPhone 6-related demand and broader RF content share gains (fueled by FBAR-related sales for 4G phones) helped Avago's wireless revenue rise 69% Y/Y in the July quarter. With the iPhone 6 launch approaching its 1-year anniversary, Y/Y comps are set to get tougher.

Avago rose 1.8% in regular trading; Broadcom rose 1.2%. Though down 13% from a spring high of $150.50 (hit amid Broadcom deal euphoria), Avago remains up 31% YTD, and has handily outperformed the Philadelphia Semi Index. Broadcom is up 23% YTD.",

Ltd. to 'BBB-' from 'BB+' and has upgraded the existing senior secured credit facility to 'BBB' from 'BBB-/RR1'. Additionally, Fitch assigns a 'BBB' rating to Avago Technologies Cayman Finance Limited's proposed $7 billion 7-Year Senior Secured Term Loan B. The Rating Outlook is Stable. Pro forma for the Term Loan, Fitch's actions affect $11.5 billion, including the undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF). A full list of Fitch's actions follows at the end of this release.

Avago will use net proceeds from the Term Loan to fund a portion of Avago Technologies Ltd.'s (Avago) acquisition of Broadcom Corp. (Broadcom). Avago plans to fund a significant portion of the merger with common stock and approximately $23.3 billion with new debt and available cash at the time of closing.

KEY RATING DRIVERS

The ratings and Outlook reflect Avago's strengthened operating profile following the Broadcom acquisition as the acquisition is expected to more than double revenue and diversify Avago's sales and profit mix. Pro forma for the acquisition, Avago will be the third largest U.S. semiconductor provider, with more than $15 billion of annual revenues. The deal also reduces Avago's reliance on smart phones, as the wireless communications segment will decline to 16% of sales after the combination from 38% on a standalone basis.

Fitch believes Avago's more diversified revenue base will reduce operating volatility over the longer-term. Fitch expects Avago will continue to benefit from technology leadership in the Bulk Acoustic Airwave market for smart phones with its premium FBAR filter. However, increased sales from longer-cycle products, including broadband and set-top boxes, will pare volatility associated with model ramps and potential technology disruption longer-term.

The acquisition strengthens Avago's FCF profile. Fitch expects $2 billion to $4 billion of annual FCF through the forecast. Profitability is expected to strengthen from the $750 million of run rate cost synergies that are forecasted to be realized within 18 months following the acquisition's close. Avago's targeted $750 million of annual cost savings are expected to offset lower blended profit margins following the acquisition. Fitch has confidence in Avago's costs synergy roadmap; however, the transaction poses material integration risks, particularly given the targeted cost synergies and research and development (R&D) intensity divergence. Beyond duplicate cost eliminations and purchasing efficiencies, cost cuts center on headcount reductions in Broadcom's comparatively heavier R&D intensity. R&D constituted 22% of LTM revenues versus just 14% for Avago. Fitch expects cash restructuring of roughly $750 million over the course of the next two years. Additionally, Fitch anticipates operating EBITDA margins of 35% to 40% through a normalized semiconductor cycle, versus latest 12 month (LTM) margins of 43% for Avago and 28% for Broadcom.

Avago has committed to using FCF for voluntary debt reduction until the company achieves its long-term total leverage target (total debt to operating EBITDA) of 1.5x to 2x, versus roughly 3x at closing. Given Fitch's expectation for more than $3 billion of annual FCF through the intermediate-term, Fitch expects Avago to reach its total leverage target in fiscal 2016. Fitch anticipates that Avago will limit share repurchases to offsetting dilution until the company achieves its leverage target. Fitch anticipates more aggressive shareholder returns thereafter, given the significant equity issuance to fund the Broadcom acquisition.

Credit protection measures will remain strong for the rating, with total leverage below 2x and gross interest coverage above 10x",

And I did want to mention for those of you who subscribe to Midstream Business, one of our most popular features is the executive Q&A that we do in every issue, and our June issue will feature a visit we had with Richard Kinder.

So if you are not a subscriber, you have time to sign up out in the lobby. We really enjoyed the conversation. He had some great insights. Presenting for Kinder Morgan this morning is Kimberly Dang, who is Vice President and CFO.

KIMBERLY DANG, VP, CFO, KINDER MORGAN ENERGY PARTNERS LP: Thank you. It is good to be here, nice atmosphere in Florida; little different from prior years.

But, at Kinder Morgan, we offer people four ways to invest. We have three publicly traded limited partner securities and one publicly traded general partner security. You can see, we have two MLPs, KMP on the left-hand side of your screen, and EPB.

On KMP, we have KMP Security is the traditional MLP security, pays a cash dividend. We also have KMR, which we created in 2001 to be economically equivalent to KMP. The only difference is, it pays is distribution in additional shares as opposed to cash. And that alleviates K-1s and some of the tax issues associated with the traditional MLP, LP unit.

Combined enterprise value of the Kinder Morgan family is about $105 billion, which makes us about the fourth largest energy company in North America. We kind of go back and forth between third and fourth with Conoco. The first two are substantially larger with Exxon and Chevron.

At -- the other unique aspect of Kinder Morgan, I think, is the significant inside management ownership. Our interests are aligned with our unitholders and our shareholders.

We have got an unparalleled asset footprint. We have got over 80,000 miles of pipelines and over 180 terminals, and we are an industry leader in all of our business segments. We have the largest natural gas pipeline network in North America.

We are the largest independent transporter of petroleum products in North America. We are the largest transporter of CO2. We are the largest independent terminal operator. And we have got the only oil sands pipe serving the West Coast of Canada.

Our strategy has been the same since inception. We want to focus on stable fee-based assets that are core to the energy infrastructure. We are focused on controlling cost. It is not our money; it is the investors' money. We want to be good stewards of that. We don't have private planes. We don't have stadiums with our names on it.

We want to leverage our footprint. You saw the footprint on the prior slide -- 80,000 miles of pipe. We want to leverage that footprint to seek attractive capital investment opportunities. And you can see there we have invested $24 billion in acquisition and about $19 billion in greenfield and expansion projects since inception.

We focus on maintaining a strong balance sheet because access to the capital markets is very important, given that we pay out of all of our cash flow. And we try to provide a lot of transparency to our investors, through publishing our annual budget and a 200-page conference book that we provide every January, with lots of details on all of our projects and all of our businesses.

We have had 18 years of consistent growth at KMP. We have grown the total distribution, so that is the distribution that gets paid out to the general partner and to the limited partner. We have grown the total distribution at 36%. We have grown the KMP distribution, so that is the limited partner portion of the distribution on a per unit basis, so taking into account all the financing costs associated with issuing additional units, at 13% per year for the last 18 years.

And we have done that without leveraging the balance sheet. You can see at the bottom that we have kept our debt to EBITDA below 4 times during that 18-year period.

And those resulted in significant returns for our investors -- historically at KMP, a 23% return since management took over in 1997. At KMR, a 13% return since 2001, which was the IPO of KMR. At KMI, 8% since we re-IPOed that in 2011; and at EPB, about a 6% return since the acquisition of El Paso in May of 2012.

As I said a minute ago, we publish our budget every year and we go over that in detail at our annual investor conference. You can see, KMI, for the three years that it has been public, we have exceeded its dividend target in the past three years. KMP, which has been public this entire period and we have been publishing that public budget since 2000, and we achieved that target 13 out of 14 years. And you can see they are in red, the one year we missed it, in 2006, we only missed it by $0.02. And then EPB, since the El Paso merger, we have achieved its distribution target in both years.

So -- and a lot of that comes from the nature of the assets and the stability of the assets and, thus, it is more easy to for us to predict what these cash flows are going to generate over the next year. So if you look on the next slide at our 2014 budget guidance, at KMI we are expecting to distribute -- or expecting to declare dividend of $1.72, which is about 8% growth over 2013. And we expect to end the year at consolidated debt to EBITDA of about 4.9 times.

At KMP, we expect to declare distributions of $5.58 per unit, which is about 5% growth over 2013, and in the year about 3.7 times debt to EBITDA. And then, at EPB, we expect to declare distributions of $2.60, which is about 2% growth, and end the year at debt to EBITDA of about 4 times. And at this point in time, we expect to meet or exceed most of these targets.

The next slide -- this is a very interesting slide and it is a newer slide in our lineup. And this really gets to the tremendous opportunities that we have in the natural gas market. As you can see, in the box on the upper left-hand corner, Wood Mackenzie is projecting that natural gas demand is going to grow from 75 BCF a day to 100 BCF a day in the next 10 years.

So that is basically a 33% increase in the demand for natural gas. And that is being driven by a couple of different phenomenons. Number one, and the largest, is just the LNG exports. And you can see in the green box, down at the bottom of the screen, they are expecting that LNG exports will grow by 10 BCF a day.

Then, the second-largest contributor to that growth is just incremental power demand, as we see the conversion of coal and fuel oil to natural gas. And they are expecting that that incremental demand is going to be 7 BCF a day.

And then, there has been $80 billion to $100 billion of investment in industrial facilities that is projected to happen on the US Gulf Coast. And Wood Mackenzie thinks that is an incremental 4 BCF a day of demand for natural gas, and then exports to Mexico is driving another 2.5 BCF a day.

And a lot of the supply is coming out of the Marcellus and the Utica. Supply there, people think will grow by almost 15 BCF a day. You are also seeing a lot of incremental supply coming out of the Eagle Ford. And there is some expectation that you are going to see some incremental supply coming out from some of the other basis basins. You know, people have put rigs back into the Haynesville.

And so, as a result of this and some of the other underlying fundamentals in the midstream energy market, I see us as projecting that we need to invest $641 billion in midstream energy infrastructure over the next 20-plus years. And so that is a tremendous increase in the annual investment that is going to be required.

And you can see this, just anecdotally, in what happened in our first quarter. We signed up 2.8 BCF a day of long-term natural gas throughput contracts. And that represents about 10% of the capacity on those pipes. And so, in one quarter, we signed up a tremendous amount of incremental demand on our system.

And we think that is just the front end of that 25 -- of fulfilling the capacity that is needed on that 25 BCF a day increase in natural gas demand. And so that is -- that and some of better things that are happening in the midstream energy business, is driving our project backlog. And, right now, we have got a project backlog of $16.4 billion that we are executing on.

Now, let me talk about how we think about our project backlog, because I know every company thinks about it a little differently. But we only put in projects that -- where we have got signed customer commitments or we think we are very close to getting signed customer commitments. And so, that means that we believe that the projects in this backlog are highly probable of happening.

And so our business development team, this isn't really what they are working on because a lot of this is largely done. And so what they are focused on is finding new opportunities to add to this backlog. And we have continued to add to this backlog.

If you look, in 2013, we added over $4 billion -- about $4.2 billion to the backlog. Now, we rolled off some projects. We rolled off about $2 billion of projects and so it was a net incremental of a little over $2 billion.

In the first quarter, we added $2.4 billion of projects. Now, we rolled off $800 million, so the net add was less than the $2.4 billion. But that just gives you a sense of what is going on in the industry and it is just increasing -- continuing to increase our project backlog.

And what this gives us confidence in is our ability to deliver growth to our unitholders and to our shareholders. And I am going to go over that with you in a minute, but basically at KMP we expect that we can grow about 5% per year; at KMI, about 8% per year. At EPB, we think that distribution will be flat for the next couple of years, but then expect to continue to deliver growth as we have some expansion projects going online.

KMP has got a very diversified cash flow. You can look there, 43% is natural gas. About 24% is CO2.

Now, CO2, we split into two components there for you. One is what we call the S&T business. That is a sales and transport business. That is really more like our traditional pipeline business where we are taking CO2 from the production area and people are paying for pipeline capacity to get that down primarily into the Permian Basin, where they utilize that CO2.

And then, our oil production business is about 17%. That is not a traditional MLP business for us. And we got into this business because, when we got the S&T business, we bought the S&T business from Shell. They came with a team that knew exactly how to flood the CO2 fields because, in order to sell the CO2 to their customers, they had to know how to do it. And so they had all these geologists and reservoir engineers on staff.

And so we have found some opportunities to buy fields, flood those fields with the CO2, and produce oil. And so the way -- the primary volatility that comes with that cash flow is really on the commodity price side. We showed you on our analyst conference that we have been within 0.05% of our budget on the volumes.

So it really comes on the commodity price side, and so we have a conservative hedging program. You can see there, we have got about 81% of our current year production hedged. And what that means is that our exposure to the change in crude oil prices is about $7 in DCF per every $1 change in the price of oil. And just putting that in context of an entity that is going to produce over $4 billion in cash flow, that is a very manageable exposure.

Our terminal segment is about 15% of our business. And products pipelines there -- we transport gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and also some crude and condensate. That is about 15% as well.

And then Kinder Morgan Canada, which is a single pipeline in Canada, that goes to the Canadian West Coast is about 3% of our overall KMP business. At KMP we have invested about $46 billion, or will have by the end of this year, $46 billion in growth capital. And you can see the layout there by year. This year's budget we are -- expect to invest about $4.8 billion. And then, that has been largely evenly split between acquisitions and expansions.

And, as you can see there on the bottom right-hand, in terms of the by -- segment, natural gas has garnered the greatest share, with everything else being pretty equal in terms of products, terminals, and CO2, Kinder Morgan Canada being a little bit smaller.

And so the question is, we are investing all this capital; how have we done on those investments. And it is not perfect, but we think we have done a good job of being stewards of our investors' money and investing that money at reasonably -- reasonable returns.

And you can see here that KMP return on invested capital in 2013 was 12.6%. And that is about 400 basis points over our long-term cost of capital. We think our long-term cost of capital is about 9%. And so what that means is, that is -- that 400 basis points is really the growth that we are delivering to our investors at KMP and at KMI.

Now, you can see that the various segments have very different returns and that goes to our investing philosophy. We look at projects on a risk-adjusted basis. If something has higher risk, for example, on one end of the spectrum we have our CO2 investments in oil fields where we are producing oil, and we have some commodity exposure. There, we target to earn 20%-plus unlevered return on those investments. And that is why you see the CO2 segment earnings a higher return.

On the other end of the spectrum, where we have -- we are building a new natural gas pipeline that has long-term -- 10-, 15-, 20-year -- take or pay contracts, meaning the customers take the capacity whether they move the molecules or not, with good credit quality customers, there, we are willing to accept a lower return, so a 12% or a 13% return. And so that is why you see different returns across our business unit because we look at the returns that we require are different based on the risk of the underlying investment.

The other thing I would say is, it is not our goal to increase this number every year. Our goal is to continue to earn nice returns on a risk-adjusted basis.

Now, you can see that our return came down in 2013 versus 2012 and that was really driven by two things. Number one is, in association with the El Paso acquisition, we had to divest some assets, and one of those assets was Rockies Express Pipeline that we built back in 2007, 2008, and 2009. That was really a forced sale. We probably didn't -- could achieve the best pricing on that.

And so there is residual carrying value that we carry in here because we didn't recover our cost. So we continue to burden the denominator in this with the residual left over, which is about $1 billion. And so that has an impact and will continue to have an impact on this going forward, but the first full year of that impact is in 2013 because that sale occurred in November of 2012.

And then the other thing is, we bought Copano at a fairly high multiple. That was a company that we bought in -- or announced it in January of 2013. And so that multiple will come down over time as the growth projects that were already underway what we bought it, come online. And so that will change over time.

EPB is focused 100% on natural gas pipelines. It has got very, very stable cash flow. 90% of its revenue comes from capacity reservation charges, meaning that our shippers pay for that capacity whether or not they move the molecules.

Here, as I said, we expect the distribution to be flat for the next couple of years, but then we have got a nice large growth project that is coming on and we would expect to resume that distribution growth.

At KMI, the cash flow at this point is largely GP cash flow. We have some cash flow that comes from the LP units. And then we really have two remaining assets at KMI. We have our 50% interest in FGP that is there as a result -- it was an El Paso acquisition asset that we have not dropped down at this point, and then a 20% interest in NGPL.

Both of these investments are held in C-Corps and so it is not as efficient to drop these assets doubt as it is the other assets that were held in partnership form. And at this point in time, we don't have any current plans to drop down either of those assets.

And then, as I mentioned a minute ago, we have got substantial ownership in KMI. Now, I think -- by management. And I think, one thing I would point out is a lot of people say, well, yes, your management all owns in KMI. And so, therefore, KMP or EPB or are going to get cheated or their incentives are in different places.

If KMP and EPB do not perform, KMI will not perform in the long-term. So if you look at how much cash flow comes up from KMP and EPB to KMI, I just showed you KMI only has two small other assets that make up a very, very small percent of its cash flow. If KMP and EPB do not do well, KMI will not do well. And so I think that aligns our management incentive with our investors, whether they invest in KMP, EPB or in KMI.

Risk, every Company has them. We like to make sure that our investors are aware of what the risks are associated with investing in the stock. Obviously, we operate and own a lot of regulated pipelines. And, therefore, from time to time, we are in rate cases on those pipelines.

We try to -- where we know that we have a rate case coming up, we try to incorporate that into our growth guidance. And so, at where we have had recently cases, we have incorporated the full year impacts into our future projections, or where we know we have one coming up or where we know we have contracts that are going to potentially roll at a lower rate. We try to incorporate that into the growth guidance that I mentioned to you earlier.

Crude oil production volumes -- I talked about that a minute ago. We have largely been very -- we have been very close to our budget on those volumes over the last five years. Commodity prices, primarily in our CO2 business, I talked about the $7 in DCF per every dollar change in the barrel of oil.

We do have some economically sensitive businesses on the terminal side. And some of those contracts are little different from what you see on the gas side, where those contracts have more volumetric exposure. And so we have a little bit of exposure on the terminal side in an economic downturn.

And then environmental and terrorism -- always a risk. We try to insure around those, but you can have some reputational risk and in the long-term, especially on the environmental side. But we are very focused on maintaining very safe and efficient operations. And we publish all of our statistics -- our EH&S -- our environmental, health, and safety statistics -- on our website. And you can see that, for the most part, we typically exceed the industry, meaning we are better than the industry average in terms of accidents and spills, meaning our statistics, we have less spills and less accidents than the industry overall.

And then, on interest rates, we have floating-rate debt, primarily at KMP. We float on about 30% of our debt. And that is about $50 million of exposure, if you have a full year of 100 basis point increase, which means you would have to see a 200 basis point increase in rates over the years to average 100 basis point increase.

So just in summary, we think that we have got an unparalleled asset footprint. We have got tremendous growth opportunities. And we think that translates into, again, 8% growth at KMI over the next three years; 5% growth at KMP and KMR, and flat distribution growth over the next couple of years at EPB, with growth expected to resume in 2017.

So with that, at looks like we have a few minutes left and I am happy to take any questions.

Questions and Answers

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Would you explain the structure of the incentive distributions paid to the general partner and amounts, if you know them?

KIMBERLY DANG: Okay. So the question is, can I explain the incentive distribution structure. So yes I can.

The general partner -- and you can see in the LP and GP distributions going up to KMI on this slide. And so, our partnership agreement was written in 1992, well before any of us were involved. And the structure shows that, as we hit certain distribution per unit on the KMP distribution, that the GP gets a larger and larger percent of the cash flow. And so, over time, and you get to a 50%/50% split of the incremental cash flow, between the LP and the GP.

We have been in the 50%/50% splits since I think 1997. And so I think there has been questions about, well, how can you manage your cost of capital, given that you have got 50% of your cash flow flowing to another entity.

And my response to that is, we have found, as you can see, $46 billion or $42 billion of capital invested over the last 17 years. And you can see the $16.4 billion of capital investments that we have, and those are coming at very attractive returns, roughly a multiple of 6 times, maybe a little bit over 6 times. And so we have continued to find attractive growth opportunities and generate growth to our limited partners and our general partner.

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: (inaudible - microphone inaccessible)

KIMBERLY DANG: Sure. So Trans Mountain is the expansion of the pipeline in Canada, which goes to the Canadian -- moves oil sands production to the Canadian West Coast. That pipeline today is about 300,000 barrels a day. The expansion project will take it to about 800,000 barrels a day -- sorry; 900,000 barrels a day. And that is a $5.4 billion project.

We approach this from a two-pronged effort because we wanted to go get approval to commercial terms, which has been approved by the NEB. So the commercial terms underlying the expansion project have been approved by the NEB. Those are primarily 20-year contracts. One of them has a 15-year contract. And then, now, we are in the process of having the NEB approved approve the facilities construction.

We filed the application on the facilities construction in December of 2013. We got the order out of the NEB setting forth the schedule earlier this year. That schedule calls for a decision out of the NEB by July 2, 2015.

So at this point in time, we are going through answering intervener requests and we will ultimately have hearings at the NEB with a decision expected out of the NEB by July of next year. I think we are confident that that pipeline will get built and that we will get the approval coming out of the NEB, just because it is so badly needed in Canada.

But, it is not going to be a smooth road between here and there. I think there will be a lot of press. I don't think that press always be positive, but I think in the end we will get it done. Sure.

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: It has been a little while since the Copano acquisition and I am wondering, do you guys find the current environment for another similar type acquisition to be an attractive one? Or is this an unexciting time for Kinder to be looking at things like the Copano -- that would be similar to Copano?

KIMBERLY DANG: Yes. Copano has been a great acquisition for us. As we said last year, it has outperformed our acquisition plan. It is fully integrated. I mean, there is no issues and everything is going as we would expect it or better.

We spend an enormous amount of time looking at acquisition opportunities and it doesn't ever slow down. But, those are hard to do, you know. It has to make sense financially. It has got to make sense strategically. And you have got to overcome, at various points in time, social issues.

And so that is one of the reasons, when we give you our growth guidance, we don't bake in any significant acquisitions, because they are just difficult to project. But, we continually look at them and when we have one to announce, we will let you know.

UNIDENTIFIED AUDIENCE MEMBER: Per your earlier slide, it looks like KMI and I guess even there owns about 40% of EPB. Given the fact that EPB is so depressed, because it has got next growth for a short time, a couple of years, why leave it out there hanging as a separate entity? I'm sure that there would be some significant economies by folding it in.

KIMBERLY DANG: The question is about -- I will just summarize -- a merger between KMP and EPB, I think, is what you are asking. And you think -- you said there might be some significant synergies. There are not a lot of synergies from merging KMP and EPB.

At Kinder Morgan, we run our natural gas franchise as one franchise, and so all of the cost savings we saw as a result of the El Paso merger with respects to the operations of those pipelines have been fully realized. ",

Welcome to the quarterly earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. (Operator Instructions)
Today's conference is being recorded. If you have any objections, please disconnect that this time. I would now like to turn the meeting over to Mr. Rich Kinder, Chairman and CEO of Kinder Morgan. You may begin.

Rich Kinder (Chairman and CEO):
Okay, thank you, Sharon, and welcome to the investor call. As usual, we are making statements within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. I will make some introductory remarks. Steve Kean, our Chief Operating Officer, will talk more about operations and our backlog.
Kim Dang, our CFO, will review the numbers for the fourth quarter and full year 2014. And Dax Sanders, our Vice President of Corporate Development, will talk about an acquisition that we just announced this afternoon. And let me just start by summarizing very briefly that acquisition. We think it's a very exciting and strategic acquisition that we announced by separate release this afternoon.
We are acquiring Highland Partners which is a large, privately owned midstream company, with crude transportation and gathering assets, and gas gathering and processing assets, primarily in the Tier 1 sweet spot acreage of the Bakken formation. It's overwhelmingly fee-based and it gives us the platform for further growth in the Bakken where we currently have no asset. We think we can to do in the Bakken the kind of expansion that we did on our Kinder Morgan crude and condensate system down here in the Eagle Ford, which has grown from less than 50,000 barrels a day throughput to having virtually all of its 300,000-barrel-per-day capacity contracted for in future deliveries.
So think of what we are doing as building a spider web that we intend to expand over the coming months and years. The consideration for the purchase is $3 billion including approximately $1 billion of assumed debt. We have a bridge loan commitment to finance the remainder, and longer term we will finance that remainder with equity and debt to maintain our appropriate level of debt to EBITDA ratio previously communicated in both the rating agencies and to our equity investors.
The transaction will be modestly accretive to DCF per share in 2015 and 2016 with the accretion ramping up thereafter and it is supported by long-term contracts with the system's largest shippers. That's an overview and Dax will give you more details in just a few minutes.
Let me get back to 2014 and the outlook for 2015. As you know, we closed the merger of all that Kinder Morgan entities into KMI during the fourth quarter, and so that made for somewhat of a noisy quarter post closing. But bottom line, our DCF per share for the quarter was $0.60 and we have declared a dividend of $0.45. That leaves excess coverage for the quarter of $320 million.
Looking at a $0.45 dividend, that's a 10% increase to the fourth quarter of 2013, and means that we will have distributed dividends for the full year 2014 of $1.74 per share versus $1.60 in 2013, and $1.72 in our plan. We were negatively impacted to a certain extent in the quarter by lower commodity prices primarily in our CO2 segment. But we were still able to produce strong results, and in my judgment that shows that our toll road-like assets perform well even when prices for underlying commodities are extremely volatile.
Looking to the future, we said when we announced the merger of all the Kinder Morgan entities back in August of 2014 that we expected to be able to declare dividend of $2 for calendar year 2015, to grow that dividend at a compound annual rate of 10% out through 2020, and to have more than $2 billion of excess coverage over that period from 2015 through 2020. We are still comfortable with the first two projections.

And we are still comfortable that we will have substantial excess coverage, but I have to admit it's hard to ascertain exactly what that amount will be given the recent volatility in commodity prices. But as an example, and an effort to be as transparent as possible, let's just take a look at 2015. When we released the outlook in December of 2014 for the year 2015 we based it on $70 oil and $3.80 gas. That's what we assumed when we did our budget back in the fall of 2014 and it represented the forward curves at that time.
We projected $2 declared dividend for 2015 and that's up 15% from $1.74 in 2014, and we said we would have, quote, over $500 million, end quote, of coverage. As we refined our budget, the actual coverage number in our budget is much greater. It is $654 million to be precise at those prices that I just mentioned.
Now in this world of lower commodity prices, we've looked closely at the impact on our excess cash and found it to be about $10 million per $1 change in crude price, and that's about $7 million in our CO2 segment that you heard us mention time and time again, pretty consistent from year to year, and about $3 million throughout all of our other business segments in the Company.
In addition, we think we have sensitivity of about $3 million for each $0.10 change in natural gas prices. Like everyone, we are unable to predict exactly where the prices will be for 2015, but you can make your own estimate and see that almost under any circumstances we have substantial excess coverage, and I think relatively little sensitivity compared to a Company that will produce about $8 billion in earnings before DD&A.
In an effort to be even more transparent, and without predicting prices at all, let me just take you through an example. Let's say you want to take our outlook and say, I believe we are going to have an average of $50 WTI crude price this year and an average of $3.20 on Henry Hub natural gas prices. What would that do to this $654 million of excess coverage on top of the $2 dividend. You would start with the crude, and you would say crude is going down by $20 a barrel. Our sensitivity is $10 million per $1, therefore, that is a $200 million degradation.
On the natural gas side, if we went from $3.80 to $3.20 that's a $0.60 degradation which would be six time $3 million or $18 million. That gets you to a total of $218 million. You take that off the $654 million and you have $436 million of excess coverage still there over and above paying a $2 dividend. Let me be real clear.
There's, obviously, a myriad of factors beyond price that influence the accomplishment of any annual plan. But I would emphasize that the commodity sensitivities that I just outlined do not -- do not -- include the positive impact of cost reductions in our CO2 EOR operations, which we are working on and believe will happen, and would certainly happen back in 2008 in 2009, the last time we had a dramatic change in crude oil prices to the negative.
So hopefully that gives you some guidance and rather than us trying to redo numbers, you can do your own figuring off of the outlook we gave you back in December, but the bottom line message from me would be that we still have lots of excess coverage. And you can roll that forward to other years and talk about exactly where the excess coverage is, and it gets even more difficult, obviously, the further out you go because who knows what the prices will be then.
But I think the main thing is this kind of toll road structure that we have allows us to survive and prosper very nicely even in a low commodity price environment. When I am finished Steve is going to detail our current backlog of projects which remain very strong. And this backlog is to me a clear indicator of future growth and cash flow at KMI. Let me close my part of the presentation by addressing succession planning at Kinder Morgan.
I have said publicly for some time that our Kinder Morgan succession plan called for Steve Kean to succeed me as CEO with me continuing as Executive Chairman. We now expect the change will take effect on June 1, 2015. Let me make a few points for you.

First of all, I can assure you this is not going to change in any way the way the Company is being run. Secondly, my name is on the door and I don't plan to go anywhere. The office of the chair will still consist of Steve, Kim and myself and post June 1 I will still be involved in all major decisions including acquisitions and expansion projects.
I want also assure you I have never sold a share of my KMI stock and I don't intend to do so in the future. So to kind of sum that area up, as we say in Texas, I plan to die with my boots on. But more importantly, Steve, Kim and the rest of the management team are doing a really outstanding job now, and I can issue you they will continue to do so in the future and that this Company will continue to grow and meet its commitments to its shareholders, its customers and its employees. And with that, I will turn it over to Steve.

Steve Kean (COO):
All right, thanks, Rich. And briefly I want to say I am honored to have the opportunity, particularly coming from Rich, who is one of the best and most accomplished CEOs in America, who by the way still has his boots on. I'm also ready and committed and determined to do my part here.
I'm excited by the opportunity, but there's no reason for any of you to be. As Rich said, you can count on his active involvement and you can count on Kim and me, the leadership team here, and our 11,000 co-workers to run this great network of assets safely, profitably and reliably every day and to continue to grow the Company.
So this will be the most seamless transition in the history of corporate America. So now let's do the quarter. Backlog first and then a segment update. On the backlog, since her investor conference in January of 2014, we have grown our backlog by nearly $2.8 billion. Our current backlog stands at $17.6 billion which is down slightly from the last quarter.
Over the quarter, we added $1.24 billion of projects while we put into service $730 million worth of projects for a net addition of about $500 million. But the impact of lower commodity prices led us to re-examine our CO2 investments, and we removed from the backlog a little under $800 million for the quarter, and the majority of that came out of the backlog for the CO2 segment. The additions to the backlog were in our Pipelines and Terminals businesses.
The largest being the addition of the Palmetto refine products pipeline serving the southeast US. That project includes the pipeline. It also includes an upstream expansion of the Plantation Pipe Line system and associated terminal investments and the total to our share, assuming others opt in for their shares, would be about $800 million.
The additions to the Terminals and Pipelines backlog underscore the continued strong demand for our midstream energy infrastructure. Now a brief segment review, and I'm going to focus on the performance on a full-year basis compared to 2013. In Gas, earnings before DD&A were up $352 million, or 9% year-over-year, to $4.069 billion. The Gas segment benefited from a full year of the assets that we acquired from Copano, including some growth in those assets, as well as strong performance from our Tennessee and El Paso system.
We continue to see strong demand for long-term firm natural gas transportation capacity. So even in this fourth quarter that we just went through, we added another 242 million cubic feet a day of long-term transportation commitments with an average term of 12.8 years. So if you look at the total going back to December of 2013, since that time, over that 13 months, we have 6.7 Bcf of new impending commitment with an average term length of 17 years.
That's about 18% of the capacity of the underlying pipeline system those commitments are associated with. We expect the demand to continue, as I think we are still at the beginning of what will ultimately be needed, both for power generation and industrial and [petchem] load. We are also seeing improvements in storage opportunities.
I think first in the current market but also in terms of the long-term commitments. We got a firm long-term commitment to 3 Bcf of storage on our Texas intrastate system by and LNG customer during the quarter, and I think all this on transport and storage side points to continued optimism about the overall value of our gas network.

CO2 segment earnings before DD&A were up $26 million or 2%. But looking at the fourth quarter on a year-over-year basis, this segment was down 6%. So clearly we faced deteriorating commodity prices in the fourth quarter. But operationally, we saw a record year at SACROC which was up 8% year-over-year, and was averaging 35,500 barrels a day in the fourth quarter and record CO2 volumes in NGL production.
Yates was down slightly, 2% year-over-year, and although Katz and Goldsmith are up on a full-year basis both continue to perform below plan. But in total, oil production is up due to the out performance at SACROC which is our biggest field. As I said, we reduced our backlog in this segment while we continue to have many good investment opportunities here. We will lay some of those out at the conference.
We delayed plans on various new developments including the St. John's field and associated pipeline infrastructure with that development. Turning to Products, segment earnings before DD&A on a full-year basis were up $76 million, or 10%, with strong year-over-year growth on KMCC and SFPP more than offsetting a decline in our transmix business. The key operational developments in this segment are improved refined products volumes and a ramp-up in crude and condensate volume on KMCC.
All refined product volumes, gas and diesel and jet, were up in 2014 versus 2013. Including Plantation, gasoline volumes were up 4.4% for the full year versus 1.5% without Plantation and 1.1% for the EIA. Much of the full-year difference is due to Plantation, therefore, but in the fourth quarter we saw gasoline volumes on SFPP, our West Coast system, up 4.4% year-over-year and what we believe is a sign of economic improvement in the markets we serve, and also, in part, perhaps the beginning of a demand response to lower prices.
From a project standpoint in Products, we are experiencing a further delay in our Houston ship channel splitter project on the KMCC system. We now expect March of 2015 in-service. On the other hand, our various build outs of the KMCC system are going very well, with several of them coming in ahead of schedule and/or under budget. And I already mentioned Palmetto, which had a successful open season in the fourth quarter and was added to the backlog.
In Terminals, segment earnings before DD&A for the year were up $181 million, or 23%. The growth was split roughly two-thirds/one-third in favor of organic growth versus growth from acquisitions. We continue to see strong performance in our Gulf Coast liquids business and benefited from the expansions coming online in Edmonton and the Houston ship channel primarily.
During the quarter, we brought online Phase 2 of Edmonton, two crude by-rail facilities, and our liquids terminal expansion for Methanex at Geismar, Louisiana. In this segment, we continue to see strong demand for liquid storage and handling, again, particularly in Edmonton and Houston. And nearly all of our $2.1 billion backlog in this segment consists of expansions of our liquids facilities, and, again, on the Gulf Coast and in Alberta. On Canada, segment earnings here were down $17 million year-over-year. That was really a result of FX rates. Otherwise, this segment had a good year.
But the main story continues to be our progress on the $5.4 billion expansion of Trans Mountain. That expansion is under long-term contracts. As you will remember, they have been approved by the NEB. We filed their facilities application December 2013 and we are working through that process, under a schedule that calls for a decision in January of 2016. And we expect an in-service date late in the third quarter of 2018.
We continue to make good progress in our consultation processes. We also recently completed some important, though controversial, testing at Burnaby Mountain in greater Vancouver, and that will enable us to minimize impacts on local residents for the last few kilometers of our build. So that's it for the segment update and the projects. And with that, I will turn it over to Kim.

Kim Dang (CFO):
Turning to the attached page numbers to the press release, the first page is our GAAP income statement. As Rich said, it was a bit of a noisy quarter given the closing of the transaction about two-thirds of the way through the quarter, and we have got a number of certain items that are littered through the GAAP income statement. So I will turn to the second page, which is where we have these items delineated so that you can see them individually, and also is our calculation of distributable cash flow for KMI.

This is a new format for KMI. Previously, at KMI, we used the financial metric cash available for dividends. We have now converted KMI to the DCF formula we previously used for KMP and EPB which is net income plus CD&A including our share of joint venture DD&A, plus booked taxes minus cash taxes minus sustaining CapEx including our share of JV sustaining CapEx, plus or minus some other small adjustments.
This formula will work for all the periods presented, even those prior to the consolidation transaction, because KMI consolidates KMP and EPB, so net income at KMI includes 100% of earnings for all three companies. For periods prior to the fourth quarter of 2014, we subtract from our DCF formula the declared distributions we made to KMP and EPB public unit holders resulting in a number for DCF that it is equal to what we previously reported as KMI's cash available to pay dividends.
For the fourth quarter, there will not be distributions made to KMP and EPB unit holders because the transaction closed before the fourth quarter record date. So there will be no MLP distributions to subtract, however, the KMI shares that we issued in November will receive the full KMI fourth quarter dividend, so in our average shares outstanding for the fourth quarter we show the newly issued shares as outstanding for the entire fourth quarter. So with that explanation of the overall format and the new format, let me take you through a couple of numbers.
This is the format that we would expect to continue to use going forward. So DCF before certain items in the fourth quarter was $1.278 billion, that's up $796 million. You can see that the 2.133 billion shares outstanding, again, include the newly issued shares for the entire fourth quarter to get us to $0.60 of DCF per share available versus the $0.45 dividend.
For the full year, we are at $2.618 billion of DCF, up $905 million. Again, the weighted average share here is 1.3 billion shares include a full fourth quarter of the newly issued shares to get us to $2 in distributable cash flow before certain items versus the $1.74. The segments, I'm going to go through couple of numbers. Steve has taken you through a lot of the detail, but the segments produced earnings before DD&A of $1.972 billion in the quarter. That is up $98 million, or 5%, with the big contributors to that being Gas up $51 million, or 5%, and Terminals up $56 million, or 25%.
For the full year, segment earnings before DD&A, up $613 million, or 9%, with the biggest contributors being Natural Gas Pipelines up $352 million, or 9%, Terminals up $181 million, or 23%, and Products Pipelines up $76 million. Now versus our budget for the full year, Natural Gas Pipelines came in above their budget. They are about 2% above their budget primarily because of incremental transport revenues on TGP and EP&G.
CO2 came in about 6%, or $90 million below its budget, primarily due to lower oil prices and a higher [mid-CUSH] spread, and also some higher expenses in our Goldsmith field. Products came in about $68 million below its budget, primarily because of volume, lower volumes on KMCC, a lot of which we will receive revenue in later years, make-up revenue, and the delay in the splitter. And then, Terminals came in about $10 million above its budget as a result of the APT acquisition.
Without the APT acquisition, Terminals would have been below its budget because of some lower coal volumes, expansion delays, and negative impact of FX. The certain items in the quarter totaled a $98 million loss. The more significant ones were the $235 million impairment on our Katz field, primarily, or all due to the lower price curves that we have to use in that test. Then we also had a benefit that offset that, a non-recurring tax benefit of about a little over $100 million. So that is it for the DCF page for KMI for the quarter.
Looking at KMI's balance sheet, and comparing that, the December 2014 balance sheet to the December 2013 balance sheet, you can see the impact of the transaction primarily in four of five different lines. In deferred charges and deferred income tax, what's happening there is KMI was previously in a deferred tax liability position because of the step-up on the transaction, and the [bate] tax basis that we are getting the assets, we actually now have a deferred tax asset and so you see a big swing between deferred income taxes and the asset deferred charges.

You also see a big increase in other shareholders' equity and a reduction in non-controlling interest as the public unit holders at EPB and KMP went away and we issued new KMI shares. The other large change is debt which I'm going to reconcile for you in just a minute. We ended the quarter with $40.6 billion of debt, which is about 5.5 times debt to EBITDA, relatively consistent with where we expected to end.
Our debt is up $5.1 billion for the quarter, and so let me take you through those -- the larger changes contributing to that. The consolidation transaction was a cash outflow of about $4.06 billion. That was $3.9 billion for the cash portion of the deal plus associated fees. Expansion CapEx, acquisitions, and contributions to equity investments were about $1.1 billion in the quarter, and then we made a CPC settlement payment of about $319 million for a cash outflow of $5.5 billion.
We raised equity prior to the close of the transaction at EPB. There was ATM of $126 million, and then we have about $250 million cash inflow from other items are working capital source, which is primarily the coverage that we generated in the quarter. And that gets you to the $5.1 billion. So with that, I will turn it to Dax.

Dax Sanders (VP, Corporate Development):
Thanks, Kim. Just to reiterate what Rich said, this is an acquisition that we are very excited about as it will give us a premier asset in a premier basin. At this point, we have a significant presence in every major producing region in North America except the Bakken. With this acquisition, we will now have a major position in the Bakken and a long-term partnership with some of the most prolific producers in the Bakken including Continental Resources .
To give you a bit of detail on the transaction, it is, again, approximately $3 billion in total enterprise value. Very slightly accretive out of the gate but based on our assumptions it should be $0.06 to $0.07 accretive a couple years out. Working through the lens of 2015 expected EBITDA, approximately 86% of the margin is fee-based with the remaining 14% subject to commodity exposure primarily through POP processing arrangements in the gas processing and gathering segment.
There are essentially three main businesses to (inaudible.) The first is oil gathering which consists of four facilities and represents approximately 59% of the EBITDA and is almost exclusively fee-based with really no direct commodity exposure. Highland serves most of the major producers in the Bakken and has over 1.8 million acres dedicated with a large piece of that centered at what many consider to be the Tier 1 portion of the Bakken, as Rich mentioned.
The second is oil transportation which is essentially the Double H pipeline. The Double H represents approximately 27% of the 2015 EBITDA and is 100% fee-based. The Double H is a 485-mile pipe extending from the [Duor] Terminal in McKenzie County, North Dakota along the North Dakota/Montana border down to Guernsey, Wyoming where it ties into Pony Express .
It includes 500,000 barrels of storage in two trunk stations. It's in the process of being commissioned right now with the initial capacity being approximately 84,000 barrels a day, but increasing to approximately 108,000 barrels a day beginning next year. (Inaudible) firm commitments for approximately 60,000 barrels a day with an open season in process right now for additional barrels, again, currently in process. As of Monday, Double H had nominations for approximately 80,000 barrels for February which is its first full month in operation.
The third business is gas gathering and processing which consists of five different facilities and represents approximately 14% of the EBITDA. It's almost exclusively non-fee-based or commodity exposed through the POPs that I mentioned earlier. Again, the largely fee-based nature of these asset limits our direct commodity exposure -- exposure to commodity prices. However, it is certainly not lost on us that there is indirect commodity exposure in that the economics of these assets are in part dependent upon whether the oil behind them continues to be produced.
We believe that the risk of the oil being produced is largely mitigated by the quality the acreage that is dedicated to Highland and will be driving the economics of oil gathering. As we mentioned in the release, the acreage driving our economics is largely located in McKenzie, Mountrail and Williams counties and represents some of the best drilling economics in the Bakken and in North America.

Consequently, we believe that this average is economic to producers even in the current commodity environment. Some Bakken producers, including some of our customers, have publicly revised their guidance for drilling and CapEx in recent weeks to account for the current commodity environment and we have taken that into account in our analysis.
Further, while nobody can really contemplate what will result from a substantial decline in commodity prices from here, the relative attractiveness of the acreage should position us well versus other acreage competing for a finite number of rigs in such an environment. Again, to summarize, we believe this is a highly strategic acquisition with some premier assets that largely fit our toll road concept and are located in an area where we have no presence. We will be inheriting a very talented group of employees that have built a great company and we look forward to doing great things with this franchise.

Rich Kinder (Chairman and CEO):
Okay. Thank you, Dax. And, Sharon, if you will come back on now we will take any questions that our listeners may have.

QUESTIONS & ANSWERS
Operator:
Thank you. (Operator Instructions) Shneur Gershuni, UBS.

Shneur Gershuni (Analyst - UBS):
Hi, good afternoon everyone. Rich, first wanted to offer congratulations on your accomplishments and Steve also wanted to congratulate you Steve on your upcoming expanded responsibilities.
Rich Kinder: Well thank you, you're kind.

Shneur Gershuni (Analyst - UBS):
Just a couple of quick questions here. I was wondering we can talk a little bit more about today's acquisition. You have had a lot of pundits out there talking about the Bakken with production being flat at best possibly declines and so forth. I was wondering if the opportunity over the next couple of years as you see accretion pick up. Is that the is that a function of moving some of the trucking volumes onto the pipeline system is that kind of how we expect to see the opportunity on a go forward basis given the bleak environment that we have out there for the Bakken.

Rich Kinder (Chairman and CEO):
Again, let me start with this. I'm not sure if we posted this on the website, but if not we should have. If you look at acreage around the country and what the breakeven price is based on the VTI prices, the area of the Bakken is right at the top of the list. Is one of the two top producing be since in terms of break-even prices. So we don't think that it is nearly as bleak as other parts of production are if you want to use that word. Secondly, obviously, the part of the upside is the ramp up in this Double H pipeline. We are starting out in the 80,000 barrel per day range ramping up to by the beginning of next year, 108,000. And again we believe that the combination and as you may know there's a joy tier of arrangement between double H pipeline and the Pony Express line that gets you all the way to Kushing and then of course there are several avenues now to get down from Cushing on down the Gulf Coast. We believe by putting all that together we provide by far the most economic way of getting barrels out of this very sweet spot in the Bakken so we think HH is a real winner both near term and long term, so that's part. The other thing is that we have looked at the EURs on these wells. We've looked very carefully at the drilling plan of our largest customer, and we have adjusted for exactly what they plan to do, what we believe they plan to do with the rig counts that have already been announced. So we think we've been pretty conservative in the way we have assessed this. And believe that it's an incredible asset for us. Let me say that beyond that I think we have the opportunity as I said in my opening remarks to do here kind of what we did in the Eagle Ford on KMCC and that is to build out this system to make it bigger to do some acquisitions to do some extensions and the fact that we have about 1.8 million acres dedicated to this, I think will show very well in the long term. You have to look at this and long term not in the flavor of exactly what's happening today. We think we had been very conservative in looking at the front end of this transaction and still think it has enormous long-term growth potential.

Shneur Gershuni (Analyst - UBS):
Just a follow-up on that, in terms of permanent financing plans, any sense on an equity to debt ratio that you are thinking about?
Rich Kinder (Chairman and CEO):
We've been very clear since the time we announced the merger last August after meeting with reg agencies that we would stay in that band of lab 5.5 to 5.0 debt to EBITDA and certainly driving that down toward the lower end of the range as we move on out toward 2020. We've been very consistent on that and we have said that the Holy Grail for us is maintaining our investment grade rating.",

The Kinder Morgan empire of companies includes Kinder Morgan Inc (NYSE:KMI) and its three subsidiaries: Kinder Morgan Energy Partners (NYSE: KMP), Kinder Morgan Management (NYSE: KMR), and El Paso Pipeline Partners (NYSE: EPB). Over the last three years Kinder Morgan has under performed many of its large peers and the market in general, stoking fears that America's fourth largest energy company will fall prey to the law of large numbers and see growth permanently slow.

In the past I've written about how Kinder Morgan's $30.4 billion in current and potential expansion projects will be enough to ensure strong distribution growth and market outperformance for decades to come. I've also written about how a potential Kinder Morgan merger could greatly increase growth, should it ever occur. Well on Sunday night news broke that Kinder Morgan was consolidating all its MLPs under its parent company in the second largest energy merger in history (the 1998 Exxon and Mobil merger worth $110.1 billion in 2014 dollars remains the largest).

Terms of the deal
The $71 billion deal is composed of $40 billion in Kinder Morgan Inc shares, $4 billion in cash, $27 billion in assumed debt. 

Existing shareholders of Kinder Morgan's MLPs will receive the following premiums for their units (based on friday's closing price):

Kinder Morgan Energy Partners: 12%
Kinder Morgan Management: 16.5%
El Paso Pipeline Partners: 15.4%
Existing unit holders of Kinder Morgan Energy Partners and El Paso Pipeline Partners are allowed to choose to receive payment in both cash and Kinder Morgan Inc shares or all cash.

SOURCE: KINDER MORGAN MERGER PRESENTATION

With 80,000 miles of pipeline and 180 terminals, the merger will create the third largest energy company in America by enterprise value ($140 billion) or fourth largest by combined market cap ($92 billion) -- behind only ExxonMobil, Chevron, and ConocoPhillips. The deal is set to close by the end of the year pending regulatory and shareholder approval. 

Why the deal is great for investors
There are three reasons why existing shareholders should be overjoyed by this deal.

First, it greatly lowers Kinder Morgan's cost of capital by eliminating El Paso Pipeline Partners and Kinder Morgan Energy Partners' incentive distribution rights and structurally subordinated debt. It will also save Kinder Morgan about $20 billion in taxes over the next 14 years. 

The second reason to celebrate this merger is that Kinder Morgan plans on turning on the growth engine in a big way, with plans to ""to pursue expansion and acquisitions in a target-rich environment,"" according to founder, chairman, and CEO Richard Kinder.

In fact, there are a combined $1.5 trillion in potential acquisition and investment targets for Kinder Morgan to pursue through 2035 including over 120 MLPs with total enterprise values of $875 billion and $640 billion in expected midstream infrastructure investments. 

Organic growth projects and accretive acquisitions are the name of the game when it comes to growing dividends and distributions, and that is where this merger should make income investors happiest. 

Dividend growth restored
Kinder Morgan has announced its intentions to raise its 2015 dividend by 16%, with subsequent 10% annual raises through 2020.",

CEO Rich Kinder has made $1.5 billion today alone on the increase in his shares[1].
The reason: Kinder Morgan has been under pressure to lower its cost of capital. The announcement instantly blows up those concerns by creating an entirely new corporate structure.
It's also a sign that Rich Kinder remains one of the canniest players in the energy world.
""""One thing Rich Kinder has shown an absolute brilliance for is reinventing his company to drive growth going forward,"""" Morningstar energy analyst Jason Stevens told Business Insider on Monday. """"It's very much unique to their current structure.""""
The Kinder Morgan family comprises Kinder Morgan Inc., a general partner, and three master limited partnerships. MLPs are publicly traded firms that pay no corporate income taxes, which allows investors to avoid getting levied twice on dividends. 
Most MLPs have two obligations: paying out to investors, and paying what amounts to a performance fee to a general partner. This gives the GP an incentive to grow returns to the MLP's investors, so that returns to the GP investors can also grow.
But the """"fees"""" to the GP increase with each increase in distribution to MLP investors. Morgan Stanley says that in many cases they can reach of 50% of the MLP's total cash payout.
And one morning, KMP investors woke up to find themselves paying out close to a 50% fee to KMI.
As Tudor, Pickering, Holt Co.'s Bradley Olsen's wrote in a note last month, KMP now sits on a $17 billion queue of """"great near-term and medium-term projects"""" including Marcellus gas and Canadian crude pipelines, as well as Mexican gas exports.
But the returns on those projects were getting shifted to KMI.
""""We assume that KMP's backlog will generate unlevered [returns] of 14%, in-line with historical averages. With the current GP burden sucking up 45% of total cash payout, a staggering $16B in projects will generate only ~$0.40-0.50/unit of [cash] at KMP, or 8% LP accretion."""" 
Hedgeye Risk Management analyst Kevin Kaiser highlighted this issue last September, calling it """"an enormous transfer of wealth from KMP [the MLP] to KMI [the GP].""""
Morningstar's Stevens estimates that KMP's all-in cost of capital was hitting as much as 12%, endangering returns to both KMP and KMI investors.
""""[For KMP] to do deals or put forward new capital growth — that's a pretty high hurdle rate,"""" Stevens said. 
So, everyone began forecasting KMP would someday """"take out"""" KMI, the parent, eliminating its albatross.
But no one expected the opposite would occur: that KMI would simply capitalize on its own lopsided cash receipts. 
""""The deal announced Sunday turns this on its head and takes advantage of the relative discount the market had assigned to KMP and other Kinder family master limited partnerships,"""" Stevens said in a note[2]. 
Here's what the Kinder family looks like under one roof:

Kinder itself had once raised the prospect of a merger. In response to a February Barron's article from Andrew Bary restating[3] the KMP payout balancing act problem, the firm released a six-page response[4] that addressed the prospect of consolidation:
Q: Would KMI ever merge with KMP the way Enterprise Products merged with its GP?
As was mentioned in our analyst day materials, KMP would consider other options if we get to a point where we cannot deliver attractive returns to LP investors. However, we do not believe we are at that point. We would point out that KMP has a highly attractive total return prospect, with a current yield of nearly 7% and a target distribution growth rate of 5% for the next three years supported by organic expansion capex projects of nearly $14 billion that we expect to place in service over the next 5 years.
Since February, the Kinder family has rallied about 8%.
And on Sunday, Kinder decided that now is the time to get even more appealing. In a note this morning, RBC capital management said the move comes a bit earlier than they'd foreseen, but that it will allow the Kinder Morgan empire to cut its capital costs by nearly half by knocking out those cash distribution obligations.
Meanwhile, everyone is crediting Rich Kinder's maneuvering. Forbes's Chris Helman points out[5] that he """"has shown an uncanny ability to move ahead of the market,"""" citing things like his early purchase of Enron's pipeline business before the energy giant collapsed; a 2006 leveraged buyout of Kinder Morgan Inc. for $21 billion, and re-IPO'ing in 2011.
""""Why should this be any different?"""" Helman says.
And that seems to be the big takeaway from the deal: Kinder Morgans problems were real, but anyone who believed they wouldn't be able to find a way out of it was setting themselves up for some pain.
There may be implications for other MLP players. Some analysts, including Morningstar's Stevens, are saying that at least one other firm, Energy Transfer Partners, is in a similar position that Kinder was in, and that there may be others.
""""There is a very strong argument that general partners get too much of the incremental cash flow, and these mergers help to address the problem,"""" SeekingAlpha user """"SeekingProfits,"""" wrote on that site[6].
Meanwhile, once the deal goes through (which won't happen until Q4), Kinder Morgan will likely be in a position to take on even more projects, including other MLPs. RCB notes KMI now expects about $20 billion of tax savings over the next decade and a half.""",

""KMI's combined set of assets generates high quality, mostly fee-based cash flow that could support a strong Baa rating,"" said Stuart Miller, Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer. ""However, KMI's aggressive financial policy that includes relatively high leverage and a very high dividend payout ratio position the rating as a weak Baa3.""

RATINGS RATIONALE

The combination of KMI, KMP, and EPBO creates one of the largest energy companies in the US capable of generating stable cashflow through a portfolio of midstream energy assets. The combination also significantly reduces the structural complexity of the organization. Through cross-guarantees, creditors will have pari passu, unsecured claims against most of the organization's assets and cash flow, removing nearly all of the structural subordination that existed under the previous organizational structure with two publicly traded master limited partnerships (MLP). The elimination of the two MLPs is a credit-positive development as MLPs are contractually obligated to distribute their cash flow to unit holders. While KMI plans to maintain an aggressive dividend policy going forward, Moody's believes the dividend program is marginally better than the MLP contractual distribution obligation.

In 2015, KMI projects the ratio of debt to EBITDA will be 5.6x, but intends to manage leverage between 5.0x and 5.5x going forward. Moody's projections arrive at the same 5.6x leverage but include adjustments for operating leases ($750 million of debt and increased EBITDA by $125 million), unfunded pension liabilities ($230 million of debt), consolidation of Kinder's share of joint venture debt and EBITDA, and a $400 million reduction to EBITDA to reflect the amount of investment that Moody's believes is necessary to offset natural production decline rates in the CO2 business. With debt to EBITDA of 5.6x and the ratio of funds from operations minus dividends to debt of less than 5%, KMI will be more leveraged than most, if not all, of its investment grade peers. The proposed dividend payout of $2.00 per share in 2015 with 10% annual growth for the next five years will also position KMI with one of the lowest dividend coverage ratios in the industry. For these reasons, Moody's believes that the re-structured company is weakly positioned within the Baa3 rating category despite its industry-leading scale. According to the company, a part of the rationale for the merger of the three companies is to make its equity shares a more attractive currency to be used in future business acquisitions. Our Baa3 rating contemplates that leverage will be reduced to the 5.0x to 5.5x range in the next few years through a combination of internal growth projects and acquisitions, although no specific acquisitions have been identified.

The ratings for all of KMI's subsidiaries subject to the cross-guarantee were revised to Baa3. The convertible subordinate ratings, junior subordinate ratings and subordinate shelf were changed to Ba1. KN Capital Trust I, KN Capital Trust III, and Paso Energy Capital Trust I had their unguaranteed preferred stock ratings revised to Ba1 to reflect the subordinated debt that structurally backstops these obligations. The rating of Kinder Morgan GP, Inc.'s preferred stock was confirmed at Ba2 as its obligations are not guaranteed and are contractually subordinated to KMI's subordinated debt obligations.

Post closing, KMI's liquidity is considered to be adequate. Operating cashflow will be mostly distributed to shareholders in the form of dividends leaving little available to reinvest in the business to fund intended growth. This will create a high degree of reliance on external sources of funding. The company has a $4 billion committed revolving line of credit which is available for general corporate purposes and serves as back up to a similarly-sized commercial paper program. The credit facility matures in November 2019 and includes a debt to EBITDA maintenance covenant that starts at 6.5x leverage with step downs to 6.0x in 2019. At the end of November 2014, we expect KMI will have more than $2.5 billion of availability under the credit facility. The new credit facility is unsecured, therefore KMI will have the ability to sell assets to generate liquidity.

The outlook is stable, however Moody's considers the company weakly positioned in its Baa3 rating level. A large increase in leverage or a debt funded share buyback could lead to a down grade. Leverage maintained above 6.0x would trigger a hard look at the company's de-leveraging plans. An upgrade is very unlikely in the near term although if the company's debt to EBITDA is sustained below 5.0x or if the ratio of funds from operations minus dividends to debt moves above 5%, it could signal a moderation in KMI's historically aggressive financial policy that could lead to an upgrade.

Express Scripts shares were up 1.2 percent.

In separate filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, Express Scripts and Medco said they expected that they may be in a position to close the transaction as soon as the week of April 2. Previously, the companies had said they expected the deal would be completed by the earlier part of the second quarter.

The companies still cautioned that there was no assurance the closing conditions would be satisfied or that the proposed deal would be consummated. A spokesman for the Federal Trade Commission, which is reviewing the deal, declined to comment, saying it was still a pending investigation.“Even though they’re not guaranteeing it’s going to close next week, it’s quite a sign of confidence,” said Jeff Jonas, an analyst with Gabelli & Co.

The offer spread was about 1.6 percent as of Wednesday morning’s trading, Jonas said, far from the 27 percent it swelled to shortly after the deal was announced last July.

The companies likely were in final negotiations with the FTC over what divestitures, if any, would be required, Jonas said.

Pharmacy benefits managers, or PBMs, handle prescription drug plans for insurance companies and employer clients, and also operate large mail-order pharmacies. Analysts have speculated that the companies may need to sell off one of their specialty pharmacies or mail-order facilities to satisfy FTC concerns.

Along with CVS Caremark Corp (CVS.N), Express Scripts and Medco are two of the three largest PBMs, and their deal would create the industry’s leader by a wide margin.

ADVERTISEMENT Express Scripts and Medco have maintained that their combination would be good for consumers because the combined company would gain more clout to drive down drug prices.

Large grocery chains, many of which operate their own pharmacies, community pharmacies and some consumer groups, have come out against the deal, saying a combined Express-Medco would gain too much power in the market and would squeeze them financially.

But recently, opponents of the deal have shifted their lobbying efforts from the FTC to state attorneys general, an indication that they believe that they have likely lost the fight at the FTC and that they hope the states will sue to block the deal.",

The merger will combine the expertise of two complementary pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) to accelerate efforts to lower the cost of prescription drugs and improve the quality of care for Americans.

""""The cost and quality of healthcare is a great concern to all Americans; this is the right deal at the right time for the right reasons,"""" said George Paz, chairman and CEO of Express Scripts. """"Companies like ours have a responsibility to provide the leadership and resources required to drive out waste in healthcare and provide the best care in the world.

""""We continue to have great confidence in moving forward as a stand-alone business, however, the incremental benefits of combining with Express Scripts are both logical and compelling.""""

Driving Out Pharmacy-Related Waste Creates Value for the Nation's Employers, Health Plans, Unions and Government Agencies

Express Scripts and Medco believe the transaction will deliver value to clients and their members, shareholders, and other stakeholders by:

Generating greater cost savings for patients and plan sponsorsCreating more efficiency in the supply chain Closing gaps in care and achieving greater adherence through our combined behavioral and clinical approachUtilizing our collective expertise to better manage the cost and care associated with specialty medicationsOptimizing our ability to respond to an increasingly complex Medicare and Medicaid environment Enhancing mail pharmacy technology to optimize patient care and satisfactionAccelerating the research, development and deployment of trend management solutions to address inefficiencies in the marketplaceContinuing to advance evidence-based and safety solutions for innovative pharmaceuticals and biosimilarsAdvancing our efforts against fraud, waste and abuseAttracting other leading healthcare entities to collaborate on next-generation solutions

Continuing a Legacy of Consumer Advocacy

Express Scripts has a history of serving American families and providing affordable benefits to businesses in a globally competitive marketplace to lower the cost of medications and to ensure their safety and accessibility. For example, by 2014, spending for specialty medicines for diseases such as cancer, multiple sclerosis and hepatitis is estimated to comprise 40% of U.S. drug spend. By combining each organization's innovative specialty patient care programs, Express Scripts will be well positioned to meet the challenges in this critical area of healthcare.

The pharmaceutical landscape is dynamic and complex. Change is constant and challenges remain in product safety, efficacy, distribution channels and the overall economics. Consumer advocacy is required. The combined company will be well equipped to create more efficiency in the supply chain to better serve employers and the American families that utilize their pharmacy benefit.

Market Dynamics / Competition

Express Scripts and Medco believe they will be successful working through the regulatory review process. Competition in the pharmacy benefit management (PBM) business is intense. Competition comes from several sources, including retail pharmacy PBMs, managed care PBMs, independent PBMs and specialized PBMs. The PBM business will continue to remain competitive after this transaction, as PBMs will continually drive for greater efficiencies to provide better service and pricing to their customers.

Terms of the Transaction

Under the terms of the agreement, Express Scripts shall form a new holding company called Express Scripts Holding Company. Medco shareholders will receive $28.80 in cash and 0.81 shares of Express Scripts Holding Company for each Medco share they own upon closing of the transaction, and Express Scripts shareholders will become shareholders of Express Scripts Holding Company receiving one share of the new holding company for each share of Express Scripts that they own upon closing. Based on the closing price of Express Scripts stock of $52.54 as of July 20, 2011, the stock component is valued at $42.56 per share, which, when combined with the $28.80 in cash brings the total value per share to Medco shareholders of $71.36. This represents a premium to Medco shareholders of 28 percent over Medco's closing share price on July 20, 2011. Upon closing of the transaction, Express Scripts shareholders are expected to own approximately 59 percent of the combined company and Medco shareholders are expected to own approximately 41 percent.

The transaction provides certain value to Medco shareholders through the cash component, as well as continued participation in the future prospects expected to result from the combination through their ownership of approximately 41 percent of Express Scripts Holding Company shares.

The merger is subject to regulatory clearance and Express Scripts' and Medco's shareholder approvals and other customary closing conditions. The terms of the merger agreement provide for the payment of termination fees in certain circumstances, but not in connection with the failure to obtain regulatory clearance. The transaction is expected to close in the first half of 2012.

The corporate headquarters will be in St. Louis and George Paz will serve as chairman and CEO of the combined organization. The Board of Directors will be expanded to include two current independent Medco board members.

The new company will draw upon the collective talent at both companies.

Appearing today before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Antitrust, Competition Policy and Consumer Rights, Express Scripts chairman, president and CEO George Paz and Medco chairman and CEO David B. Snow, Jr., offered the following insights and observations in their prepared oral and written testimony:

George Paz, Chairman, President and CEO, Express Scripts:

""""We will lower drug costs that are far too high and improve health outcomes for consumers. As the big drug companies merge, as large chain drug stores buy up their competition and demand higher prices, we must become more effective representing the interests of plan sponsors and consumers. Patients - not profits - must come first.""""

""""As healthcare spending continues on an unsustainable trajectory, pharmacy benefit managers have reduced drug costs by 30 percent or more each year through innovative technology and products. These savings are passed on to plan sponsors and consumers.""""

""""Before a consumer ever receives their medicine, my company runs over 100 safety checks through our innovative advanced technologies. This is critical because the PBM is the only one with visibility across all pharmacies used by the consumer. Our systems identify and prevent dangerous drug interactions across all of these pharmacies.""""

""""Beyond wasteful prescription drug spending, waste includes unnecessary hospitalizations, testing and treatment in costly emergency rooms. These are very real problems with costs across the entire health system, and PBMs are the most advanced partners to provide common-sense solutions.""""

""""Express Scripts and Medco have complementary clinical capabilities to serve all patient groups. By combining these offerings, we can pioneer new drug safety systems, create new resources for public health, and continue to advance evidence-based medicine to better serve our patients.""""""",

The deal would be the biggest ever in the healthcare services industry and give Express Scripts close to one-third of the pharmacy benefits market, gaining much more leverage for negotiating drug prices for employers and other clients who must reduce their exposure to spiraling healthcare costs.

The industry’s expertise in managing pharmacy spending has made its services all the more attractive and lured new competitors like insurer UnitedHealth Group.

The deal would also give the combined company greater clout against drugstore chains like Walgreen Co and increase competition with the likes of CVS Caremark Corp.

“They would be more than twice as big as their next largest competitor,” Morningstar analyst Matthew Coffina, referring to CVS. “Scale is really what matters in this business in terms of bargaining power relative to suppliers, the ability to operate mail order facilities and process claims efficiently.”

Guidant shares climbed more than 8 percent in midday trading.","NATICK, Mass. — Boston Scientific Corp. made an unexpected, $25 billion takeover offer Monday for the troubled medical device maker Guidant Corp., more than $3 billion more than what Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay for Guidant last month.

Guidant shares climbed more than 8 percent in midday trading.

Boston Scientific, which makes heart devices, offered in a letter to Guidant’s chairman to pay a combination of cash and stock worth about $72 per Guidant share. It said that is nearly 14 percent above Friday’s value of J&J’s revised cash-and-stock deal for Guidant.

The offer comes nearly a year after J&J said it would buy the Indianapolis medical-device maker for $25.4 billion. But J&J cut its offer by nearly $4 billion after a series of product recalls by Guidant, and Guidant management accepted the lower price last month.

Boston Scientific executives said the prospect of entering the lucrative $10 billion market for implantable pacemakers and defibrillators by purchasing Guidant outweighs the legal risks posed by Guidant’s recent problems.

“We understand there have been some recent issues, but we believe they are manageable,” Boston Scientific Chief Operating Officer Paul LaViolette said in an interview with The Associated Press.

Indianapolis-based Guidant said it had received the proposal and its board would consider it. “Guidant will have no further comment on this matter at this time,” it said in a statement.A Johnson & Johnson spokesman did not return three calls seeking comment Monday.

Boston Scientific said it was prepared to sell Guidant’s stent business to satisfy regulators but wanted to retain some shared rights in Guidant’s drug-eluting stent program, which has not yet brought a product to market. Boston Scientific has one of the best-selling drug-eluting stents on the market in Taxus, which competes with the Cypher stent made by J&J’s Cordis Corp. unit. Stents are metal-mesh devices surgically inserted to keep coronary arteries propped open after surgery to clear blockages.

“We are prepared to divest them. We think that will address any competition concerns,” LaViolette said in the telephone interview.

Attractive despite recalls
Jeffries & Co. analyst Ryan Rauch said Guidant remains attractive despite the recalls — perhaps even more so to Boston Scientific, which has seen its profits dwindle recently.

“Guidant would shore up Boston Scientific’s 2008 pipeline, if they’re willing to take significant dilution to their shares in the short-term,” Rauch said.

John Putnam, an analyst with Stanford Group Co., said Guidant must give the new offer serious consideration. Not only is Boston Scientific offering more money, but such an acquisition would be more like a merger of equals. A potential pitfall for Guidant would be the cost of any breakup penalty in its deal with J&J. In the original deal, the cost was $750 million, but the companies have not yet filed an amended agreement with regulators.

“Strategically, it’s a better fit for Guidant being with Boston Scientific than being with J&J,” Putnam said. J&J also would be hard pressed to enter a bidding war, after rancorous negotiations that resulted in its lower price for Guidant, he said. “It’s going to be tough for J&J to make another offer that’s close to Boston Scientific.”

Johnson & Johnson and Guidant renegotiated their deal when J&J considered pulling its original offer of $76 a share made last December after Guidant suffered through the recall of thousands of implantable heart devices over the summer.

Since June, Guidant has recalled or issued warnings about 88,000 heart defibrillators — including its top seller, the Contak Renewal 3 — and almost 200,000 pacemakers because of reported malfunctions.

Guidant had filed a federal lawsuit to force J&J, based in New Brunswick, N.J., to complete its original takeover agreement.

J&J renegotiated the original deal and Guidant accepted on Nov.

15. At the time, the J&J offer was worth $63.08 per Guidant share, or $21.5 billion, but the value has since risen to about $63.43 per share, based Friday’s closing price of J&J stock. Johnson & Johnson makes an assortment of medical and health care products. Richard Langan, a merger expert and a partner with the law firm Nixon Peabody in New York, said that under the original agreement with J&J, once Guidant’s board determined Boston Scientific was offering a better deal, J&J had five business days to come back with a competing offer.

Analyst Rauch said he did not expect Guidant’s shareholders would embrace J&J’s offer over Boston Scientific’s, given the premium and the frayed relations between Guidant and J&J. Rauch said J&J was not likely to sweeten its offer.

“There’s no love lost between Guidant and J&J,” Rauch said. “I believe J&J will not come back into the dance at a higher price.”

The Boston Scientific offer consists of $36 in cash and $36 worth of its shares for each share of Guidant stock. J&J is offering $33.25 in cash and 0.493 share of Johnson & Johnson common stock for each Guidant share.

If Guidant accepts Boston Scientific’s offer over J&J’s, that could put pressure on J&J to make an offer to buy another medical devices maker, St. Paul, Minn.-based St. Jude Medical Inc., to compete against a Boston Scientific-Guidant combination, Rauch said.

Rauch said a Boston Scientific-Guidant deal could hurt Boston Scientific’s short-term share price because of the acquisition’s cost. But in the longer term the deal could help shore up Boston Scientific’s pipeline, which has yet to produce a potential blockbuster product to match the sales boost the company has enjoyed since the Taxus stent reached the U.S. market in March 2004.

""Shareholders will benefit from the significant upside potential of the combined company, while doctors and their patients will continue to receive the most technologically advanced and highest quality medical devices and therapies.

The transaction is subject to customary closing conditions, including clearances under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and the European Union merger control regulation, as well as approval of Boston Scientific and Guidant shareholders. The transaction is not subject to any financing condition. Boston Scientific expects to complete the transaction by the end of the first quarter of 2006.

As previously announced, Boston Scientific has entered into an agreement with Abbott (NYSE: ABT) under which Boston Scientific has agreed to divest Guidant''s vascular intervention and endovascular businesses, while agreeing to share rights to Guidant''s drug-eluting stent program. Under its agreement with Abbott, Boston Scientific will receive $6.4 billion in cash from Abbott on or around the closing date of the Guidant transaction. This amount consists of $4.1 billion in purchase price for the Guidant assets, a loan of $900 million, and Abbott''s agreement to acquire $1.4 billion of Boston Scientific common stock. Boston Scientific and Guidant believe that Boston Scientific''s agreement with Abbott will enable Boston Scientific and Guidant to rapidly secure antitrust approvals for the proposed transaction.

Under the terms of the merger agreement between Boston Scientific and Guidant, each share of Guidant common stock will be exchanged for $42.00 in cash and $38.00 in Boston Scientific common stock, based on the average closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during the 20 consecutive trading day period ending three days prior to the closing date. If the average closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during this period is less than $22.62, Guidant shareholders will receive 1.6799 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant common stock, and if the average closing price of Boston Scientific common stock during this period is greater than $28.86, Guidant shareholders will receive 1.3167 Boston Scientific shares for each share of Guidant common stock. Guidant shareholders will own approximately 36 percent of the combined company.

Then last week, Boston Scientific outbid J&J and seems to have cinched the deal.

The loss was unquestionably a blow to J&J, which is having trouble finding new growth opportunities. And J&J's stock has since fallen to a 15-month low. There's an argument, however, that J&J is fortunate not to have succeeded in acquiring Guidant.Whatever advantages the acquisition might have created, Guidant would have come with a lot of problems. Now, the investment case for J&J has become a whole lot simpler.

To understand why losing the deal may be a win for J&J shareholders, it's worth looking back at the twisted history of the proposed Guidant acquisition.

J&J first agreed to acquire the heart-care company in December 2004 at a price of $76 a share.

The following year, however, the Food and Drug Administration prompted Guidant to announce several product recalls. Occasional problems with the FDA are not all that unusual for companies that produce high-tech medical devices. But they are costly and can damage business franchises if they occur repeatedly.

In response to Guidant's problems, J&J lowered its bid to around $63 a share in November.

Three weeks later, Boston Scientific (Research) jumped in with its own higher offer, and a bidding war followed.

Now Boston Scientific has won, but it sure has paid a high price for Guidant. In addition, both businesses continue to have problems with the FDA about manufacturing standards.

Boston Scientific's share price is down nearly 20 percent since the company first bid for Guidant. Analysts are divided about the stock's near-term prospects, although several think the company has probably hit bottom. But even Boston Scientific acknowledges that earnings may not benefit from the acquisition until 2009.

By contrast, J&J has been cut loose from the complexities surrounding Guidant. J&J still has the problem of finding growth opportunities, particularly as some of its existing blockbuster drugs come off patent. But the company also has a fairly strong pipeline of drugs under development.

J&J is already among the best-diversified health-care companies, and most analysts think it will continue looking for acquisitions. The most frequently mentioned possibility is St. Jude Medical, which is undeniably attractive but would be expensive to acquire.

Another alternative would be the purchase of a series of smaller medical-device companies, such as Edwards Lifesciences. It's even conceivable, although not likely, that the deal between Boston Scientific and Guidant could fall apart and that J&J might get a second shot at Guidant at a more attractive price.

In any event, any of those deals would still lie in the future. Right now, J&J (Research) is simply a very high-quality blue chip with moderate growth prospects, little debt and at least $12.5 billion in cash over and above its liabilities.

The total return potential may not be spectacular, but it's certainly attractive. Earnings growth could be as low as 5 percent this year, but it should average more than 10 percent annually over the next five years. And the stock yields 2.2 percent.

At the current share price of $58.40, J&J is trading at only 16 times earnings for the current year. That's a very reasonable price/earnings ratio for a stock that is slightly above average in growth potential and way above average in quality.

Here's how it happened."," On a warm August evening in Manhattan, the former leaders of medical-device maker Guidant joined their investment bankers in a private room at the tony Bouley restaurant to celebrate the sale of their company to Boston Scientific (Charts).

The stormy weather turned out to be an omen, because while the lawyers and bankers were of course well paid for their efforts, the deal turned into a deluge of bad days for the Boston brass. In late June, Boston Scientific issued recalls or warnings on almost 50,000 Guidant cardiac devices and acknowledged that it could take as long as two years to fix its safety problems. On Sept. 21, Boston issued a profit warning that shocked Wall Street, sending its already beaten-down shares plunging another 9.2 percent in a single day. Since it announced the bid for Guidant last December, Boston's stock has dropped a stunning 46 percent, wiping out $18 billion in shareholder value in a matter of months. Indeed, the deal is arguably the second-worst ever, trailing only the spectacular AOL Time Warner debacle (see ""Buyer's Remorse,"" page 112). ""It's like the movie The Money Pit,"" Matthew Dodds, an analyst at Citigroup, says of Boston's handling of the deal. ""Once you've put enough in, you'll go all the way till it's done, regardless of the value.""

Today Boston CEO Tobin finds himself spending two days a week at Guidant's St. Paul headquarters so he can personally manage continuing product calamities at the business he fought so hard to buy. Right now, he tells Fortune, Guidant's operations are producing zero profit. That's right, Boston is earning zip on a multibillion dollar investment. Part of the reason is that Tobin hasn't cut expenses to match the steep drop in sales. ""We need to spend in a way that will solve our product problems and maintain our excellent sales force until the market bounces back,"" he says.

But it will take far more than an uptick in sales to rescue Boston from this fiasco. To discover how a seasoned team of shrewd dealmakers came to pay so much for so little, Fortune pored over thousands of pages of corporate filings and interviewed more than 15 board members, executives and lawyers involved in the deal (almost none of whom would speak for attribution). What emerges is a roller-coaster tale of bet-the-franchise corporate brinkmanship, miscalculation and overreaching. It is a stark lesson on how the single-minded pursuit of victory can blind even brilliant execs to the true costs of a deal. It's also a study in wildly contrasting personalities locked in gladiatorial combat: the colorful, swashbuckling crowd from Boston vs. the cautious, by-the-book executives at Johnson & Johnson, who, despite their stiff bearing, proved as tough as they are proud. And it sheds new light on the surprisingly brutal world of the medical-devices industry, which helps save thousands of lives a year but is marked by deep personal animosity and ferocious combat in the the marketplace and the courtroom - where the battle over Guidant continues.

In late September, Johnson & Johnson sued Boston, Guidant and Abbott (Charts) for $5.5 billion, claiming they violated terms of its deal with Guidant. Indeed, Johnson & Johnson has reason to be sore. While it seemed to win by losing - it isn't saddled with Guidant's woes - it also enabled a powerful competitor to emerge: Abbott Labs, the quiet kingmaker in this otherwise disastrous merger, which, by playing both sides of the deal, came out as the one clear winner.

The target: a graying Guidant
Spun out of drug giant Eli Lilly (Charts) in 1994, Guidant was a reflection of the two very different men who ran it: Jim Cornelius and Ron Dollens. Cornelius, Guidant's chairman, was Lilly's former CFO, a taciturn numbers man who helped Guidant generate huge earnings gains from tiny dollops of new capital (He's now serving as interim CEO at Bristol-Myers Squibb (Charts)). Dollens, a sunny extrovert, was a supersalesman who had run Lilly's medical-devices business. As a sales manager in San Francisco in the early '80s, Dollens reveled in his unhipness, sporting plaid pants and wide ties in a trendy town.

Under this well-matched pair Guidant combined technical innovations and a powerhouse sales force to capture around 35 percent of the $10 billion market for pacemakers and defibrillators by 2004. During that ten-year stretch the stock surged 2,200 percent, driving Guidant's market capitalization to about $20 billion and making its executives rich.

And after ten years of trench warfare in the famously combative industry, Cornelius and many of the Lilly crowd who ran Guidant were ready to savor their success. Cornelius and his wife, an artist, were spending long stretches at their spectacular oceanfront home in Hawaii. In mid-2004 Dollens, the only CEO in Guidant's history, announced he would retire at year's end. A top operating official, Jay Graf, left his post in July 2004. Other key execs, now wealthy, were ready to follow suit.

As the invitations went out for Dollens's gala retirement party, to be held at a management retreat in Lake Tahoe, Guidant's board launched a search for a CEO and hired J.P. Morgan and Morgan Stanley to help explore a sale. Boston Scientific wasn't the first suitor; Johnson & Johnson - a venerable giant looking for a dose of growth - expressed an interest. Yet Guidant swiftly rejected its initial bid of $68 a share. Guidant's stock had been soaring on takeover rumors and was already close to what J&J was offering. Cornelius & Co. were looking for a premium.

Besides, they had their eyes on a potential CEO. After rejecting four internal candidates, Guidant's board embraced Joseph Hogan, then 47, a fast- rising executive in General Electric's medical division. The board hoped that the problem of Guidant's future was solved - until GE came back at Hogan, offering to make him chief of GE Medical Systems, the company's trophy $10-billion-a-year business. Hogan decided to stay put.

So when J&J CFO Bob Darretta called his counterpart at Guidant in November 2004 to discuss a new deal, he found a receptive audience. And with its stock up almost 15 percent since the last offer, J&J could sweeten its bid without offering more shares. In December, J&J proposed paying $76 a share, or $25.4 billion, with 60 percent in stock, 40 percent in cash. Guidant accepted. And no wonder. At that level, J&J was paying a huge multiple of almost 50 times Guidant's earnings.

A prize beyond Band-Aids
By J&J standards, CEO William Weldon is a revolutionary. A burly former forward for Quinnipiac University's basketball team, he boasts a crushing handshake, a broad smile and a shock of white hair that he's always brushing off his forehead. He came aboard in 2002 determined to shake up the venerable maker of Band-Aids, Tylenol and baby powder, and his plans included making bolder acquisitions.

As Weldon saw it, Guidant was just what the doctor ordered. After decades of double-digit gains, J&J's sales, now $51 billion a year, were jogging along at a middling pace, and J&J's pharmaceutical business was a laggard. By adding Guidant's pacemakers and defibrillators to its product lineup, J&J could improve its position with hospitals and cardiologists. And there was a bonus: Guidant had a highly promising drug-coated stent in development, the Xience and a proprietary technology for implanting stents called Rapid Exchange that was already extremely popular with doctors. Adding those products to J&J's existing stent business could provide a dramatic jolt.

The one complication was that the Federal Trade Commission might very well ask J&J to divest Guidant's ""interventional cardiology"" business - consisting of stents and the balloons, guide wires and other gear used to implant them - as a condition for approving the deal.

So J&J turned on the D.C. charm. Over the next ten months, in a series of meetings, letters and phone calls, J&J's lawyers argued that the competitive landscape could be maintained if Johnson & Johnson shared Guidant's delivery technology with one rival. In a stunning success for J&J, the FTC accepted the argument, requiring J&J to license Rapid Exchange to a single competitor. Medtronic, America's largest device maker, eagerly courted J&J for the privilege. But instead Johnson & Johnson turned to what seemed at the time to be a less threatening player - Abbott Labs. That decision would come back to haunt J&J.

The trouble begins
Guidant CEO Dollens agreed to postpone his retirement to shepherd the transaction with Johnson & Johnson. But what should have been a victory lap turned into a slog through the swamp. In March of 2005 a 21-year-old student named Joshua Oukrop, who had a Guidant defibrillator implanted in his chest, died of a heart attack while bicycling. The defibrillator short-circuited, failing to release the shock that could have saved his life.

Guidant had discovered the short-circuiting problem three years earlier and had corrected it in new models. Yet the company never informed doctors that devices already in use carried a small but potentially fatal risk of failure. Oukrop's cardiologist complained to Guidant that it should immediately warn doctors about the short-circuiting problem. With the story about to break in the New York Times, Guidant finally came clean, issuing a recall of the flawed defibrillators in June.

But the bleeding didn't stop there. A series of damning investigative stories in the Times then detailed problems with several other models. Over the next few months Guidant issued recalls on 290,000 devices, covering a dozen types of defibrillators and pacemakers. By late October, Guidant's stock dropped from the mid-70s to the mid-50s.

Johnson & Johnson's Weldon still wanted to buy Guidant - just at a lower price. He cut his offer by $6 billion, from $76 a share to about $58 a share. Guidant's directors were indignant, according to former board members. They believed that J&J was trying to use Guidant's temporary misfortunes to, in a favorite phrase at board meetings, ""steal the company."" When they rejected the offer, Johnson & Johnson sued to abrogate the sales contract, and Guidant countersued.

But at the same time the parties kept talking and J&J cranked its offer up to $63 a share. Still unhappy, Guidant's directors didn't have a lot of options: There was no one to run the company if they spurned J&J, and they also worried about a ""bomb in the basement"" - additional product blowups that could destroy even more of Guidant's value. On Nov. 15, Guidant grudgingly accepted the new offer. It seemed to be totally at the mercy of J&J. But that was about to change.

Enter the wedding crasher
Boston Scientific in late 2005 was a spectacular growth company running out of ways to grow. It was founded in 1979, when Pete Nicholas and scientist John Abele borrowed heavily and raised $800,000 to buy a tiny manufacturer of devices for minimally invasive surgery. Boston flourished thanks to a series of bold acquisitions engineered by two men who loved the rush of dealmaking, Nicholas and Larry Best, the CFO who arrived in 1992. Nicholas is married to the former Ginny Lilly, a great-great granddaughter of the founder of Eli Lilly, where Nicholas started his career as a drug salesman. An avid yachtsman, Nicholas prides himself on audacity, on confounding competitors with unexpected plays. By mid-2004 Nicholas had parlayed his cards at Boston into a net worth of $4 billion.

In the merger game, Nicholas found a perfect partner in Best. A former accountant at Ernst & Young, Best is a mercurial street fighter who, as one friend puts it, ""doesn't like to lose and doesn't lose very often."" He thinks nothing of picking up the phone to upbraid analysts who give Boston poor reviews. For Best, it's a point of pride that Boston is still managed like a fast-growing startup.

For all Nicholas's dealmaking prowess, his best move may have been the 1999 hiring of Jim Tobin as CEO. Tobin, a veteran drug exec who excels at launching new products, orchestrated the debut of the Taxus drug-coated stent in early 2004. The Taxus quickly grabbed more than half the market from its only competitor, J&J's Cypher. By early 2006 Taxus accounted for more than 60 percent of Boston's operating profits.

The success of the Taxus made Boston a major power but left the company without a follow-up act. The stent business, though highly profitable, is growing at just 5 or 6 percent a year. So Boston was on the prowl for another big acquisition. In fact, Nicholas and Best had long coveted Guidant - the two companies talked about a merger in the early 1990s. ""But as we both became a big deal, we didn't think we could get antitrust approval,"" says Tobin, who adds that he was impressed by the ruling J&J secured from the FTC.

The prospect of J&J winning Guidant was especially galling to Boston because of the bad blood between the two firms. According to chairman Nicholas, the feud dates back to the mid-1990s, when J&J proposed buying Boston. When Boston refused, Nicholas told Fortune in 2004, J&J struck back with a barrage of lawsuits. ""After that it was all-out warfare,"" says Nicholas. ""Both sides went to full battle dress.""

On Nov. 1, 2005, Pete Nicholas of Boston Scientific called Guidant's Cornelius. The two pharma veterans had been friends since they went through the same internship program at Eli Lilly together 39 years before. Nicholas informed Cornelius that Boston was interested in buying Guidant. According to people familiar with the conversation, he told Cornelius that he thought J&J was trying to stick it to Guidant, using its leverage to capitalize on its temporary woes.

Cornelius, at that point still locked into a contract with J&J that prevented him from discussing a merger with another bidder, told J&J about the call the next day. But J&J and its investment bankers didn't take Nicholas's overture seriously. They reckoned that Boston wasn't big enough to buy Guidant. They also assumed that Boston would need many months to go through an antitrust review, just as J&J had, and that the harried Guidant board would never accept such a delay. Those were all valid points. But J&J had underestimated Boston's resourcefulness and, most of all, its hunger for Guidant.

Abbott switches sides
Boston desperately wanted to bid, but it had a lot of work to do. In early November, just after Nicholas called Cornelius, the Boston deal team huddled at the company's sprawling campus in the Boston suburbs. Gathered in the conference room were Nicholas, Best, and Tobin, along with lawyers from Shearman & Sterling and bankers from Merrill Lynch. Just as J&J had assumed, they faced two major challenges: Boston had to raise money, since it didn't have enough in its own coffers to finance a deal. And it had to arrange to sell Guidant's interventional cardiology business, since keeping it would likely invite a long antitrust review that the Guidant board would never tolerate.

On Dec. 5, Boston announced its intention to make a $72-a-share bid for Guidant. To solve both its antitrust and financing problems, a few days later Tobin put in a call to Abbott CEO Miles White. ""We have some ideas to discuss,"" he said, according to someone familiar with the conversation. ""I thought you might,"" replied White. Renowned for its HIV and epilepsy drugs, Abbott (2005 sales: $22 billion) had signed on with J&J to license Rapid Exchange in the event of a deal, but J&J and its lawyers had failed to include language that would have blocked Abbott from helping Boston. White would exploit that mistake for all it was worth. The two CEOs turned the negotiations over to subordinates who hammered out the details of a deal that would catapult Abbott to the front ranks of the most lucrative medical-device market ever.

Rather than just a license for Rapid Exchange, Abbott would get the Xience stent, inherit the crack sales force and own Guidant's entire interventional cardiology business, including its spectacular product pipeline and state-of-the-art manufacturing. In return, Abbott would go a long way toward financing the deal. It agreed to buy Guidant's stent business from Boston for $3.8 billion and to lend Boston $700 million at a bargain interest rate. J&J was furious.

Over the next month the Boston team hunkered down again at headquarters to do its due diligence on Guidant, living on hoagies and salads, conducting meetings that started at 8 A.M. and went long into the evenings. The lawyers and investment bankers were amazed at the tenacity and stamina of Nicholas, then 64, who fired off question after question about Guidant's recalls. It was Tobin who assured the team that while the problems were serious, they were ""manageable"" and that the Guidant franchise wasn't ""permanently impaired."" On Jan. 8, Boston made its official bid, with Abbott as its partner: $72 a share, topping J&J by $9, or more than $2.9 billion. The game was on.

From weakness to strength
With Boston's offer in hand, Guidant's board - led by Cornelius, who replaced Dollens as CEO in November - played the two bidders like a virtuoso. On Jan. 11, J&J raised its bid to $68 a share. That was $4 below Boston's bid, yet the Guidant board continued to back J&J, provoking howls of protest from institutional investors and Boston CFO Best. But the board's posture had been carefully calculated.

""The shareholders thought we favored J&J, but we didn't,"" says a former Guidant director. ""We wanted to keep Boston bidding as long as possible. We weren't going to get the highest bid from Boston once we said we preferred their offer."" Sure enough, on Jan. 12, Boston raised its bid to $73. J&J came back at $71.

Once again the Guidant board endorsed J&J. A two-buck-a-share advantage, it seemed, wasn't going to be enough for Boston to prevail. The Guidant board also wanted a deal that was virtually certain to close, and to close quickly, which meant no antitrust hassles. The main sticking point: In its deal with Abbott, Boston had insisted that Abbott not license Rapid Exchange and other technology to other firms. Guidant feared that the provision would take months of antitrust review to get approved.

Guidant had read Nicholas and Best just right: For the next round, they would do just about anything to win. On Sunday, Jan. 15, the Boston deal team met in Natick, Mass. In the conference room that morning, Larry Best told the group that Boston shouldn't make another ""incremental bid."" ""We need to make a bid that ends this, to swing for the fences,"" said Best, according to one person in the room. Best proposed $80, and Nicholas and Tobin agreed. The rest of the day, Best worked on hammering out a new agreement with Abbott. In a rapid-fire series of phone calls to Abbott COO Richard Gonzalez, Best persuaded him to increase the price Abbott would pay for the Guidant assets by $300 million, and buy $1.4 billion in Boston stock - in effect, Abbott was financing most of the increase in Boston's offer. Boston also dropped its pet provision, the co-exclusivity agreement with Abbott, to ensure quick antitrust approval.

On Jan. 17, Boston delivered its knockout offer of $80 a share, or a total of $27 billion, 52 percent in cash and 48 percent in stock. It also agreed to a ""hell or high water"" clause saying that no matter what the FTC required, it couldn't walk from the deal. Nor could it escape if any of the products having problems suffered more recalls or lawsuits, or otherwise caused financial damage. If the deal didn't close by March 31, Boston would also pay interest for each additional day. (The parties agreed on a rate of 6 percent a year, which ended up costing Boston $90 million.) Finally, Boston expanded the ""collar"" that would require it to hand over more shares if its stock price dropped. (In the end Boston had to increase the shares handed to Guidant's stockholders by 16 percent.)

J&J still had a week to counter. A board meeting - 13 months after J&J and Guidant signed their first deal - was held by conference call, hosted by Weldon from J&J's headquarters in New Brunswick, N.J. Directors expressed astonishment at Boston's final offer. Weldon and CFO Darretta reminded the board that J&J had run five- to seven-year profit projections, making the most optimistic assumptions about Guidant's growth, and it still couldn't justify an offer above $71. Weldon said that J&J ""won't chase this deal to a price that doesn't make sense for the company."" J&J made no further offer.

Boston had won. At a celebratory investor presentation in late January, it heralded the deal as historic. It predicted double-digit growth for the troubled cardiac-device market in 2006 and big market-share gains for Guidant. The forecasts proved spectacularly wrong.

Tallying the score
The leaders of Boston viewed the deal as an unalloyed triumph. In May the board granted big bonuses to six executives who'd helped orchestrate the merger. CFO Best received a special one-time package worth about $1.2 million. And the deal was widely lauded.

The Institutional Shareholder Services, the agency that advises stockholders on how to vote on mergers, praised the deal. No fewer than 13 analysts covering Boston, including those of HSBC, Lehman Brothers, and Sanford C. Bernstein, called it a winner, and placed an average target price of $36 on its shares. And Boston executives still insist their acquisition will pay off. ""This is a transforming deal that makes us far better positioned for double-digit growth,"" CFO Best told analysts on a recent conference call, adding that it should be judged three or four years from now, not on today's temporary setbacks.

But the math never made sense. Today Boston's shares are languishing at $15, and even a major comeback at Guidant is unlikely to restore the stock to its glory days. In fact, the deal is an object lesson in the dangers of dilution. To buy Guidant, Boston increased its share count by 80 percent and took on $6.5 billion in debt - on which it is paying more than $300 million a year in interest. Yet Guidant will contribute exactly nothing to Boston's earnings this year, so Boston is already losing money on the deal.

And from this point, climbing out of the hole becomes almost impossible. In 2005, Guidant earned $355 million on cardiac devices; even if Guidant's earnings quickly return to that level, those profits would have to grow by 22 percent a year for 15 years for Boston to earn a 9 percent return on its $25 billion investment, estimates Steve O'Byrne, a valuation expert with Shareholder Value Advisors.

Guidant, on the other hand, secured an astounding price for its assets. Guidant shareholders who sold their stock before the deal closed on April 21 got virtually the full $80 a share, thanks to the collar and all the other generous protection provisions. Even loyalists who held on haven't fared too badly. Today, despite the decline in Boston's share price, they still hold a total package of cash and stock worth $66 a share, $3 more than they'd have received from J&J if Boston hadn't barged in.

Abbott is the other big winner. Its stock price has climbed 22 percent this year, to $48. Citigroup's Dodds reckons that by 2009, Abbott's operating earnings from the Xience stent and other Guidant assets will reach $650 million - about the same number he expects Boston's Guidant business to earn. Yet the deal cost Abbott a pittance compared with the $25 billion that Boston paid.

Abbott did suffer one setback. Its role didn't sit well with Johnson & Johnson. The Boston/ Guidant deal had barely closed when J&J ended a co-marketing agreement with Abbott for its Cypher stent. That move will prove costly to Abbott, at least temporarily. It was collecting around $120 million a year in commissions on Cypher sales. Now it will have to keep its sales force on the payroll while it waits for the Xience to reach the U.S. market, with no drug-coated stent to sell.

As for J&J, the outcome was a mixed blessing. To be sure, by not paying billions for an ailing company it dodged a disaster and got a $705 million breakup fee. And the deal has hobbled a rival, in Boston. But J&J also lost some ground. Abbott will soon be a potent competitor in stents. It wouldn't have been nearly as powerful if J&J had bought Guidant. Abbott can also license Rapid Exchange to new competitors, another negative for J&J. Nor can J&J deploy Guidant's technology for its next-generation stent. ""J&J does not have a strong stent program going forward,"" says Glenn Reicin, a medical-devices analyst at Morgan Stanley.

Last call
Out in St. Paul, Jim Tobin - the best operating executive in the medical-devices industry - is attacking Guidant's product woes, establishing an independent quality division that reports to top management and pushing a new technology called Latitude, a system that monitors heart problems from a box at the patient's bedside. ""Doctors understand the life-saving benefits of these devices and double-digit market growth will come back,"" says Tobin.

For Tobin, reviving Boston's flagging business is more than a matter of pride: He holds grants of restricted stock that give him $14 million if the stock reaches $35 and $150 million if it gets to $75. Tobin thinks his package will still pay off. He's so confident, he says, that he won't push the board to reprice his shares. Tobin believes in the kind of wow-the-critics heroics Boston is renowned for. But this time Boston made a deal that's beyond redemption.",

","Indianapolis, Ind. — (AP) - Boston Scientific Corp. made an unexpected, $25 billion takeover offer Monday for the troubled medical device maker Guidant Corp., more than $3 billion more than what Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay for Guidant last month.

Guidant shares climbed more than 8 percent in midday trading. But two analysts questioned whether J&J will sweeten its bid.","Indianapolis, Ind. — (AP) - Boston Scientific Corp. made an unexpected, $25 billion takeover offer Monday for the troubled medical device maker Guidant Corp., more than $3 billion more than what Johnson & Johnson agreed to pay for Guidant last month.

Guidant shares climbed more than 8 percent in midday trading. But two analysts questioned whether J&J will sweeten its bid.

Boston Scientific, which makes heart devices, offered in a letter to Guidant's chairman to pay a combination of cash and stock worth about $72 per Guidant share. It said that is nearly 14 percent above Friday's value of J&J's revised cash-and-stock deal for Guidant.

Guidant's cardiac rhythm management division is based in Arden Hills. Boston Scientific makes stents at a facility in Maple Grove.

The offer comes nearly a year after J&J said it would buy the Indianapolis medical-device maker for $25.4 billion. But J&J cut its offer by nearly $4 billion after a series of product recalls by Guidant, and Guidant management accepted the lower price last month.

Boston Scientific executives said the prospect of entering the lucrative $10 billion market for implantable pacemakers and defibrillators by purchasing Guidant outweighs the legal risks posed by Guidant's recent problems.""We understand there have been some recent issues, but we believe they are manageable,"" Boston Scientific Chief Operating Officer Paul LaViolette said in an interview with The Associated Press.

Indianapolis-based Guidant said it had received the proposal and its board would consider it. ""Guidant will have no further comment on this matter at this time,"" it said in a statement.

A Johnson & Johnson spokesman did not return three calls seeking comment Monday.

Boston Scientific said it was prepared to sell Guidant's stent business to satisfy regulators but wanted to retain some shared rights in Guidant's drug-eluting stent program, which has not yet brought a product to market.

Boston Scientific has one of the best-selling drug-eluting stents on the market in Taxus, which competes with the Cypher stent made by J&J's Cordis Corp. unit. Stents are metal-mesh devices surgically inserted to keep coronary arteries propped open after surgery to clear blockages.

""We are prepared to divest them. We think that will address any competition concerns,"" LaViolette said in the telephone interview.

Jeffries & Co. analyst Ryan Rauch said Guidant remains attractive despite the recalls - perhaps even more so to Boston Scientific, which has seen its profits dwindle recently.

""Guidant would shore up Boston Scientific's 2008 pipeline, if they're willing to take significant dilution to their shares in the short-term,"" Rauch said.

John Putnam, an analyst with Stanford Group Co., said Guidant must give the new offer serious consideration. Not only is Boston Scientific offering more money, but such an acquisition would be more like a merger of equals.

A potential pitfall for Guidant would be the cost of any breakup penalty in its deal with J&J. In the original deal, the cost was $750 million, but the companies have not yet filed an amended agreement with regulators.

""Strategically, it's a better fit for Guidant being with Boston Scientific than being with J&J,"" Putnam said. J&J also would be hard pressed to enter a bidding war, after rancorous negotiations that resulted in its lower price for Guidant, he said. ""It's going to be tough for J&J to make another offer that's close to Boston Scientific.""

Johnson & Johnson and Guidant renegotiated their deal when J&J considered pulling its original offer of $76 a share made last December after Guidant suffered through the recall of thousands of implantable heart devices over the summer.

Since June, Guidant has recalled or issued warnings about 88,000 heart defibrillators - including its top seller, the Contak Renewal 3 - and almost 200,000 pacemakers because of reported malfunctions.

Guidant had filed a federal lawsuit to force J&J, based in New Brunswick, N.J., to complete its original takeover agreement.

J&J renegotiated the original deal and Guidant accepted on Nov. 15. At the time, the J&J offer was worth $63.08 per Guidant share, or $21.5 billion, but the value has since risen to about $63.43 per share, based Friday's closing price of J&J stock. Johnson & Johnson makes an assortment of medical and health care products.

Richard Langan, a merger expert and a partner with the law firm Nixon Peabody in New York, said that under the original agreement with J&J, once Guidant's board determined Boston Scientific was offering a better deal, J&J had five business days to come back with a competing offer.

Analyst Rauch said he did not expect Guidant's shareholders would embrace J&J's offer over Boston Scientific's, given the premium and the frayed relations between Guidant and J&J. Rauch said J&J was not likely to sweeten its offer.

""There's no love lost between Guidant and J&J,"" Rauch said. ""I believe J&J will not come back into the dance at a higher price.""

The Boston Scientific offer consists of $36 in cash and $36 worth of its shares for each share of Guidant stock. J&J is offering $33.25 in cash and 0.493 share of Johnson & Johnson common stock for each Guidant share.

If Guidant accepts Boston Scientific's offer over J&J's, that could put pressure on J&J to make an offer to buy another medical devices maker, St. Paul, Minn.-based St. Jude Medical Inc., to compete against a Boston Scientific-Guidant combination, Rauch said.

Rauch said a Boston Scientific-Guidant deal could hurt Boston Scientific's short-term share price because of the acquisition's cost. But in the longer term the deal could help shore up Boston Scientific's pipeline, which has yet to produce a potential blockbuster product to match the sales boost the company has enjoyed since the Taxus stent reached the U.S. market in March 2004.

Shares of Guidant surged $5.26, or 8.5 percent, to $67.08 in midday trading on the New York Stock Exchange.

Johnson & Johnson shares rose 17 cents to $61.38 on the NYSE, while Boston Scientific shares fell 8 cents to $27.25. Shares of St. Jude Medical rose $2.62, or 5.4 percent, to $50.89 on the NYSE.",

The shift came after Guidant's board had twice rejected higher offers from Boston Scientific in favor of J&J proposals that Guidant had said offered a speedier route to completion after more than 13 months of contentious dealmaking.

But Boston Scientific on Tuesday morning increased the stakes again by offering a price more than $2 billion richer than its previous bid last Thursday — a far higher increase than it had made in previous rounds. Boston Scientific added other enticements as well, and sought to sway Guidant's board in its favor by negotiating new terms in a third-party deal that will raise more cash for Boston Scientific to complete a Guidant acquisition.

Guidant said in a brief statement that its board determined that Boston Scientific's revised offer ""is superior to the terms of the company's current merger agreement with Johnson & Johnson."" The statement did not elaborate.

In a short statement, Johnson & Johnson said it believed Boston Scientific's proposal would hurt the earnings potential of the combined company and leave it saddled with too much debt. J&J also said the proposal was based on ""extremely aggressive business projections.""

""The company will consider its alternatives under the existing merger agreement with Guidant,"" J&J said.

Boston Scientific, based in Natick, Mass., said, ""We look forward to working together to complete the transaction.""

Shareholders are to vote on J&J's offer Jan. 31. But with Indianapolis-based Guidant declaring Boston Scientific's bid superior, J&J now has five business days — until the end of business Jan. 24 — to counter it under the terms of its agreement with Guidant. Boston Scientific's offer will remain open for formal acceptance by Guidant until Jan. 25.

J&J and Boston Scientific, rivals in the market for drug-coated heart stents, are dueling for Guidant's business in implantable defibrillators and pacemakers, a fast-growing $10 billion business in which neither suitor is a player.

Tuesday's big price increase from Boston Scientific led analysts to speculate the bid was a last-ditch attempt to trump J&J, which is based in New Brunswick, N.J.

With its latest $80-per-share offer, Boston Scientific ""is clearly playing to win,"" said analyst Dhulsini De Zoysa of SG Cowen & Co.

She said J&J — a far larger company than Boston Scientific — has the financial capacity to increase its offer from its current $71 a share. But she said J&J is unlikely to go above the $76-per-share proposal it initially presented in December 2004, before product recalls and safety warnings at Guidant led J&J to reduce its offer.

""I think it would be very difficult for J&J to defend an offer above its original $76-a-share bid,"" De Zoysa said. ""A solution that might satisfy the Guidant board as well as shareholders is to offer $76 a share with a higher cash component, or offer to pay all in cash.

""By restructuring the terms, they could make a final offer that is attractive in that it offers the certainty of cash.""

More cash would reduce the risks Guidant shareholders would face from fluctuations in the stock price of the winning suitor after a deal closes.

J&J's current offer calls for $40.52 in cash and 0.493 shares of stock for each Guidant share.

Boston Scientific had previously offered an equal amount of cash and stock, but boosted the cash component Tuesday by offering $42 in cash and $38 in stock for each Guidant share.

It said its latest offer amounts to a premium of $9 per share, or a total $3.3 billion, over the latest J&J offer.

The bidding war began Dec. 5 when Boston Scientific made an unsolicited $24.6 billion offer. The move came after Guidant's product recalls led J&J to reduce its price from the original $25.4 billion to $21.5 billion.

Boston Scientific bid up to $25 billion last Thursday. J&J responded Friday with a $24.2 billion offer that Guidant's board accepted, citing that deal's greater certainty and its clearance of an antitrust review.

While Boston Scientific's offer remains higher, Guidant would have to pay a $705 million break-up fee to J&J if it walks away from their deal. The fee had been set at $625 million, but has been increased twice in the most recent J&J offers.

Boston Scientific's latest bid amends a separate deal announced Jan. 8 to address antitrust issues and fears that a regulatory review could slow any deal. The new proposal raises the price that Abbott Laboratories Inc. will pay for Guidant's vascular business from $3.8 billion to $4.1 billion.

Abbott, based near Chicago, also will increase the amount it lends Boston Scientific to $900 million from $700 million, and Abbott will buy $1.4 billion worth of Boston Scientific's stock — deals that are contingent on Boston Scientific acquiring Guidant.

Boston Scientific said the revisions would give it an initial $6.4 billion from Abbott to help close a Guidant deal.

","Two years ago this month, Boston Scientific Corp. appeared poised to become Massachusetts' biggest corporation, unveiling an audacious $27 billion agreement to buy Guidant Corp. But Boston Scientific chief executive Jim Tobin didn't even have a chance to celebrate.

Hours after the Natick-based maker of medical devices inked the Guidant deal, Tobin received bad news. The Food and Drug Administration sent Boston Scientific a rare ""corporate warning letter,"" slamming the company for poor quality controls and blocking it from rolling out new products in the United States, including another heart stent to keep cleared arteries open.","Two years ago this month, Boston Scientific Corp. appeared poised to become Massachusetts' biggest corporation, unveiling an audacious $27 billion agreement to buy Guidant Corp. But Boston Scientific chief executive Jim Tobin didn't even have a chance to celebrate.

Hours after the Natick-based maker of medical devices inked the Guidant deal, Tobin received bad news. The Food and Drug Administration sent Boston Scientific a rare ""corporate warning letter,"" slamming the company for poor quality controls and blocking it from rolling out new products in the United States, including another heart stent to keep cleared arteries open.

Things got worse. Because of industry safety scares, sales stalled in Boston Scientific's two key product lines, drug-coated stents and the defibrillator business it acquired from Guidant, based in Indiana.

The company faced a wave of costly litigation, some of it related to Guidant. And many analysts questioned whether Tobin overpaid for Guidant, weighing Boston Scientific down with billions in debt.

The events of the last two years have taken a toll on the company, once the state's largest life sciences firm. Financial analysts downgraded its bonds to near junk territory. Its stock has fallen in half since the Guidant deal was announced, reducing its market value to $18 billion.

""I can't recall a major medical-device company having this sustained of a downturn,"" said Dan Owczarski, a financial analyst with Avondale Partners, a Nashville investment-banking firm. ""It's almost unbelievable. It continues to go in the wrong direction.""

Yet Boston Scientific officials insist the company is on the verge of a turnaround. The company recently shed billions of dollars in debt and cut thousands of jobs to boost profits. It hopes to resolve the FDA concerns by midyear and has started releasing new products in specific sectors exempt from the FDA warning.

And most important, executives say, sales are poised to grow again this year, despite skepticism on Wall Street.

""As we look forward, the future is brighter than it has ever been,"" Tobin insisted in a recent interview.

If he is right, it would be the latest comeback in the company's storied history. Boston Scientific was founded in 1979 by Peter Nicholas and John Abele, who met while watching their children play soccer in Concord. It went public in 1992 and through a series of acquisitions, it became one of the biggest medical-device companies in the country and one of the state's biggest corporations. It also turned both cofounders into billionaires. Until the recent cutbacks, the company had 28,000 employees worldwide, including 2,400 in Massachusetts.

But Tobin, a former Biogen executive who became Boston Scientific's chief executive in 1999, noted the company was also struggling in 2001 before bouncing back. Its stock soared after it helped pioneer a generation of stents - tiny mesh tubes used to prop open arteries - by coating them with medicine to keep the vessels clear. It is now the world's biggest stent maker, thanks to its flagship Taxus model.",

Caremark's Crawford will become the chairman of the combined company and Tom Ryan, his counterpart at CVS, will become president and chief executive.

Express Scripts , a rival pharmacy benefits manager, dangled a $27.2 billion dollar carrot in front of Caremark. But the company’s shareholders were weary of anti-trust issues and believed CVS's package was comparable in value. A higher offer may have swayed shareholders, but earlier this week, Express Scripts announced that it would not raise its bid unless its rival disclosed confidential financial information.

Momentum immediately shifted to CVS and after four months of contentious debate and legal quibbles, “a substantial majority of outstanding shares were cast in favor of the merger,” Caremark said in a statement on Friday.

CVS shareholders approved the deal Thursday and management is expected to close the transaction next week.

""Today's vote reinforces the compelling logic underpinning the merger of the nation's largest pharmacy chain with the leading pharmacy services company and speaks to the tremendous opportunity we have before us,"" said Tom Ryan, chief executive of CVS.


According to analysts surveyed this week, the closing gap between the two competing firm's offers and the looming antitrust issue, swayed shareholders in CVS's favor. “As we wrote yesterday, we could not see many Caremark shareholders rejecting a CVS offer worth over $62 to take their chances instead with the uncertain Express Scripts bid,” Goldman Sachs said in a note on Friday. Goldman Sachs predicted a 17% upside over the next year and reiterated a “Buy” rating.

The merger will help CVS boost in-store traffic and should increase both companies’ consumer base. CVS can now draw on Caremark’s mail order business and Caremark will be able to offer costumers CVS store promotions. In addition, both companies will realize purchasing benefits by ordering prescriptions in bulk.

“CVS paid a fair amount,” Joseph Agnese, an equity analyst for Standard & Poor said in an interview on Friday. “The combined offering is a very innovative move on the part of CVS because its never been done on this scale.” CVS currently has a small pharmacy benefits manager business but this acquisition will give it a major competitive edge over traditional drug store chains.

However, Andrew Speller, an analyst for A.G. Edwards & Sons, said on Thursday that the eventual merger could be difficult for both companies because one specializes in retail and the other is a benefits manager. ""Historically, they're not matched well,"" Speller said. A synthesis of two pharmacy benefit managers, as proposed by the Express Scripts deal, may have provided more long term value for Caremark shareholders.

Under the CVS merger agreement, Caremark share holders will receive 1.67 CVS shares for each Caremark share and a $7.50 special dividend per share.

CVS may have emerged as the clear victor in the final hours, but the union did not seem inevitable when the company first announced its $21 billion bid in November. Many Caremark share holders fiercely opposed the proposal and when Express Scripts launched a hostile $26 billion takeover effort, some Caremark shareholders rallied to the rival’s offer. The bidding war was froth with fiery accusations, including claims that Caremark’s management prevented competing bids to favor the CVS deal because it promised huge payouts for senior executives. Caremark has also accused Express Scripts of using their merger offer as a Trojan horse to weaken its competitor. Express Scripts “was never serious about making a real offer for Caremark, instead seeking to disrupt our business and our merger agreement with CVS,” Caremark said in a statement this week.

Caremark shares dipped 0.73%, 46 cents a share, to $62.29 at the close of trading Friday while CVS fell 1.32%, 44 cents a share, to $32.90.",

","Pharmacy benefits manager Caremark Rx Inc. (CMX) and drugstore chain CVS Corp. (CVS) confirmed Wednesday discussions of ""a possible merger of equals transaction,"" which could transform the healthcare industry.

The companies' press release, affirming an earlier New York Times report, didn't offer any details on the deal's potential terms, although a ""merger of equals"" transaction usually suggests a smaller premium. Caremark's market capitalization, based on early trading Wednesday, was $21.6 billion, while CVS' was nearly $24 billion.

Merging the largest pharmacy benefits manager with one of the largest U.S. drugstore chains would create a major player in the healthcare industry, with significant buying power in generic drugs and dominant positions in numbers of retail outlets and mail-order capability, an increasing component of drug distribution. UBS analyst Neil Currie said the scale could be used as a weapon to gain market share in both the PBM business and retail pharmacy.

A deal also increases CVS' access to members of Medicare's prescription drug plan, giving the drugstore the ability to market its front-end retail business directly to Caremark's members. A tie-up also would help fight off an increasing threat from Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (WMT), which has cut prices on some generic drugs, threatening margins at PBMs and drugstores

PBMs like Caremark handle prescription-drug benefits for individuals on behalf of clients, namely employers and health plans, and operate their own mail-order pharmacies.

Following the news, Caremark shares rose 2.9% to $50.65. The stocks of other PBMS also rose. Medco Health Solutions Inc. (MHS) shares gained 1.1% to $54.10, while Express Scripts Inc. (ESRX) added 2.8% to $65.47.

Goldman Sachs analyst Christopher McFadden said news of the possible deal suggests an easing in the ""traditional animosity between retailers and PBMs"" in light of growth opportunities presented by the Medicare prescription drug program and national employer contracting. He also noted ""signs of market maturity for the PBM sector.""

CVS shares, though, fell 7.8% to $28.94. Deutsche Bank analyst William Dreher Jr. said that should CVS acquire Caremark, uncertainty about future results could pressure CVS shares in the short-term, with the deal's perceived benefits at least a year away.

Shares of drugstores chains and PBMs have declined since the middle of September from a perceived Wal-Mart threat. In September, Wal-Mart vowed to cut the price on some generic drugs to $4 for a 30-day supply. Since Sept. 13 and before Wednesday, Caremark's stock had fallen 17%, while CVS' stock lost 10% over that time frame.

Wednesday, Wal-Mart shares slipped 21 cents to $49.07.

The other drugstores slid Wednesday on the prospects of an energized rival. Walgreen shares lost 2.8% to $42.47, while Rite Aid dropped 1.9% to $4.59.

Any deal could pressure drug wholesalers, specifically McKesson Corp. (MCK), which gets 11% of its revenue from Caremark, and Cardinal Health Inc. (CAH), which gets 21% of its revenue from CVS, according to Revere Research.

McKesson shares dropped 1.2% to $49.49 Wednesday, while Cardinal Health added 19 cents to $65.64.

Doubts About Merger

Banc Of America analyst Robert Willoughby doubts a merger will occur.

""CVS Corp. may just be there for a look under the hood and to boost valuation, "" Willoughby said in a research note. ""A transaction is possible, but unlikely, in our opinion.""

Willoughby thinks another PBM is a more likely acquirer of Caremark.

Citigroup analyst Charles Boorady disagreed, saying he doesn't expect any bids from other PBMs because any such deal would create antitrust concerns. The analyst also doesn't see any offers from managed-care companies, which ""can build much cheaper, something they are already doing."" Plus, he added, there would likely be negative synergies because employers might move business away from Caremark to an independent PBM.

But that doesn't mean others won't make a move, Boorady said.

""We can't rule out another type of buyer such as another retailer or financial buyer given strong cash flow of $1.3 billion a year and very strong industry growth prospects for PBMs,"" Boorady said.

Caremark's strong cash flow and little debt would be a positive for CVS' credit profile, Gimme Credit said. Nonetheless, the independent research service maintains its underperform recommendation and ""deteriorating"" credit score for CVS until more is known

""There is the specter of using some (any) borrowed cash either to cement the deal or to buy back stock to offset any dilution. Needless to say, this would not be pleasant for CVS bondholders.""

Wednesday, the risk premiums on bonds issued by CVS edged higher. Spreads, or risk premiums, on CVS's 6.125% notes due 2016 were four basis points wider at 112 basis points, according to MarketAxess, an electronic trading platform for corporate bonds. The cost of protecting CVS bonds, as measured by credit default swaps, also rose modestly.

In August, Moody's Investors Service affirmed a long-term rating of Baa2 on CVS, leaving the company two steps above junk ratings. Standard & Poor's rates the company one notch higher, at BBB+.

Goldman Sachs analyst John Heinbockel thought any deal would add immediately to CVS' earnings, by up to 3%, but dilute its return on invested capital.

CVS Acquisitive

Caremark Rx is the largest PBM by market capitalization, providing drug benefit services to more than 2,000 health plan sponsors and their plan participants throughout the U.S. The company also operates a national retail pharmacy network with more than 60,000 participating pharmacies. It was not immediately clear how that network would be affected by any such deal with CVS. Goldman's Heinbockel said he doubted other retailers would opt out of Caremark plans ""given the magnitude of profits that come from these plans.""

For the year ended Dec. 31, Caremark reported earnings of $932.4 million, or $ 2.05 a share, on revenue of $33 billion.

CVS is the largest drugstore by store count, operating about 6,200 retail and specialty pharmacy stores in 43 states and the District of Columbia. Last month, CVS lifted its third-quarter and 2006 earnings guidance, citing September same- store sales and a ""solid improvement"" in gross margins.

For the year ended Dec. 31, CVS reported earnings of $1.2 billion, or $1.45 a share, on sales of $37 billion.

UBS' Currie said an acquisition of Caremark could provide CVS with the ability to market its front-end retail business directly to Caremark's members. He said that strategy has been successful with CVS' Pharmacare PBM, where CVS has offered front-end discounts to PBM customers.

CVS has been acquisitive this year. In June, CVS bought 700 Osco and Sav-On pharmacies from $2.93 billion and indicated then that it was in the market for more acquisitions.

Chief Executive Tom Ryan said at the time that he was unfazed by recent downgrades of CVS debt by credit-rating companies concerned about the amount of debt incurred as part of the drugstore chain's most recent purchase.

""This is a still consolidating industry,"" Ryan said then. ""Acquisitions are a big part of our business, and we do [them] well.""

Since then, CVS bought Minneapolis-based MinuteClinic, a provider of retail- based health clinics in the U.S. Terms were not disclosed.",

The company said an aging population, an increased prevalence of chronic health conditions and the increase in the use of Medicare insurance is fueling the need for prescription drugs. The move also comes in the wake of Wal-Mart Stores Inc.'s move to slash prices on certain generic drugs.

Under terms of the Wednesday deal, CVS would swap 1.67 shares of CVS for each share of Caremark. Based on CVS's market price, near $28.80, the deal values Caremark at about $48.10. This is below where Caremark shares were trading earlier Wednesday, when news of the talks became public.

Caremark CMX, +0.00% fell $1.06, or 2.2%, to close at $48.17, while shares of CVS sank 7.4% to finish the session at $29.06.

""The strategy is to get more leverage over drugmakers as the pressures mount to lower the cost of prescription drugs,"" said Mitchell Corwin, an equity analyst with Morningstar.

The combined company, to be called CVS/Caremark Corp., is to be headquartered in CVS's hometown of Woonsocket, R.I. The combined pharmacy-benefits management, specialty pharmacy and disease-management businesses will be headquartered in Nashville, Tenn., where Caremark is currently based, the companies said.

Combined projected revenues for CVS CVS, -0.32% and Caremark for 2006 are $75 billion, after adjusting for intercompany transactions.

""This merger is a logical evolution for CVS, Caremark and the entire pharmacy industry,"" said Tom Ryan, chairman and chief executive of CVS. ""Together, CVS and Caremark will help manage the costs and complexities of [the U.S. health-care system], offering unparalleled access and driving superior [health] outcomes, enhancing value for employers, health plans and consumers."" See related story.

Closer to the consumer
CVS stockholders, under the deal's terms, will own 54.5% of the combined company, while Caremark stockholders own 45.5%. The board of directors of the new company will be split evenly between the two entities. Caremark's chairman and CEO, Mac Crawford, is to become chairman of CVS/Caremark, while Tom Ryan becomes president and CEO. CVS Chief

Financial Officer David Rickard has been tapped to be CFO of the combined company. Caremark Chief Operating Officer Howard McLure is penciled in as president of the Caremark pharmacy-services business.

""Caremark has been focusing on moving our services closer to the consumer as the consumer is being asked to become more involved in [health-care decisions] through changes in plan designs, the adoption of consumer directed plans and, of course, the introduction of Medicare Part D,"" Crawford said.

The companies expect the combination to add to earnings in the first full year after close.

Caremark, which sells drugs to participants in benefit plans through direct mail or through networks of pharmacies it doesn't own, has a market capitalization of about $21.5 billion.

Pharmacy-benefit managers acquire prescription drugs from manufacturers; they both administer them through benefit plans and dispense them directly through their own mail-order pharmacies.

""A merger between the two would create a major player in the health-care industry,"" UBS analyst Neil Currie said.

Merging Caremark with CVS would give rise to a company with ""significant buying power in generic drugs and dominant positions in numbers of retail outlets and mail-order capability,"" Currie wrote in a note to clients.

CVS has a chain of 5,471 stores in 37 states and the District of Columbia. The company already has a pharmacy-benefits management arm, as does No. 1 drugstore operator Walgreen Co. WAG, +0.00%.

Medco Health Solutions Inc. MHS and Express Scripts Inc. ESRX are other major players in the pharmacy-benefits-management category.

Wal-Mart's long shadow
""Should CVS acquire Caremark we believe that the increased uncertainty about future results could pressure the shares in the short term, while longer-term benefits could be at least a year away,"" Deutsche Bank analyst William Dreher said in a research note. ""Strategically, such a deal could likely prove highly beneficial over the long term, to improve [CVS's] third-party plans negotiation power and their ability to secure product at lower cost.""

Dreher cut his rating on CVS shares to hold from buy.

Both companies of late have been hurt by Wal-Mart's WMT, +0.62% plan to offer monthly prescriptions for certain generic drugs at $4.

Wal-Mart in September announced a sweeping plan to cut these generics' prices, and accelerated the pace of the rollout. The move by the world's largest retailer pressured drugstores and pharmacy-benefits managers alike.

Wal-Mart's aggressive step ""created an increased level of transparency in prescription-drug prices,"" Morningstar's Corwin said. ""It's a matter of time before [drugstores] are pressured to lower prices on generics as well.""

The deal will be subject to stockholder approvals at both companies as well as customary regulatory approvals, including antitrust review in the U.S. The companies expect the transaction to close within 12 months.

The combined company's ordinary shares are to trade on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol ""CVS.""

Caremark's financial advisers on the transaction were J.P. Morgan and UBS, and its lawyers were King & Spalding LLP for general legal matters and Jones Day LLP on regulatory matters.

CVS received investment-banking advice from Evercore Group and Lehman Brothers, and it was advised on general legal matters by Davis Polk & Wardwell and on regulatory matters by Mintz Levin Cohn Ferris Glovsky and Popeo P.C.
